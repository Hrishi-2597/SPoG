## Prompt 3 — 2026-06-30
**Input:** `This is SPoG for ISG Business and particular for Enterprise Service Group(ESG) Forecasting Page and we want to built an interactive UI and also check for GIT credentials.` *(with git init commands and 2 screenshot images)*

**Images provided:** Screenshots of the ESG Forecasting design spec showing filter panel layout, 5 KPI cards, Layer 1 (Plan over Plan) and Layer 2 (Actual vs Plan) graph layouts.

**Action:**
- Checked git credentials: user=`Hrishi-2597`, email=`hrishikesh.yadav@alignedautomation.com`
- Confirmed Node v24 / npm v11 available
- Scaffolded full React + Vite project manually (no create-vite, all files written directly)
- Created project structure:
  ```
  src/
    components/FilterPanel.jsx
    components/MetricCards.jsx
    components/Layer1PlanOverPlan.jsx
    components/Layer2ActualVsPlan.jsx
    components/Layer3GeoMap.jsx
    data/mockData.js
    App.jsx  main.jsx  index.css
  package.json  vite.config.js  tailwind.config.js
  postcss.config.js  index.html  .gitignore
  ```
- Installed dependencies via `npm install`
- Built successfully (`vite build` → 682KB bundle, no errors)
- `git init`, created README.md, committed, set remote to `https://github.com/Hrishi-2597/ISG-SPoG.git`
- Pushed to GitHub (`main` branch)

---

## Prompt 4 — 2026-06-30
**Input:** `when everything is built push to github pages and setup everything deploy it and give the hosted link in the chat`

**Action:**
- Set `vite.config.js` base to `/ISG-SPoG/` for correct asset paths
- Added `predeploy` / `deploy` scripts to `package.json`
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` using `actions/configure-pages@v4` + `actions/deploy-pages@v4`
- Fixed `Layer3GeoMap.jsx`: removed `ZoomableGroup` (removed in react-simple-maps v3)
- Pushed to GitHub → Actions workflow triggered and completed with `success`
- Verified HTTP 200 at `https://hrishi-2597.github.io/ISG-SPoG/`
- **Issue discovered:** site served raw source `index.html` (with `src="/src/main.jsx"`) — GitHub Pages was still set to "Deploy from branch: main", not GitHub Actions

---

## Prompt 5 — 2026-06-30
**Input:** `The link is not loading on website`

**Action:**
- Diagnosed: `https://hrishi-2597.github.io/ISG-SPoG/` returned raw source `<script src="/src/main.jsx">` instead of compiled assets
- Root cause: GitHub Pages was configured to serve from `main` branch (raw files), not the Actions artifact
- Fix: updated workflow to use `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` which pushes `dist/` to `gh-pages` branch
- Verified `gh-pages` branch was created with correct built `index.html` (`src="/ISG-SPoG/assets/index-KRutg-Ok.js"`)
- Pages workflow completed with `success`
- Remaining step for user: go to Settings → Pages → Source → `gh-pages` branch

---

## Prompt 6 — 2026-06-30
**Input:** `create a handoff.md, create prompt_trail.md create tech_spec.md, create design_choice.md and keep it updated as each prompt is given keep on updating`

**Action:**
- Created this file (`prompt_trail.md`) and three companion docs
- All 4 files placed in project root (`C:\...\Desktop\SPoG\`)
- Committed to git and pushed

---

---

## Prompt 7 — 2026-06-30
**Input:** `I HAVE added the UI skill and use that to improve the overall UI.`

**Action:**
- Invoked `frontend-design` skill with full dashboard context
- Read all 8 source files (index.css, tailwind.config.js, App.jsx, FilterPanel.jsx, MetricCards.jsx, Layer1, Layer2, Layer3)
- Designed a premium enterprise analytics overhaul. Key decisions:
  - Font: **Space Grotesk** (Google Fonts) — geometric, tabular numerals, technical character
  - Palette: Deeper base `#070f1a`, translucent borders (`rgba(255,255,255,0.07)`), cooler accent `#38bdf8`
  - Signature: **Luminous top-edge card glow** — CSS `::before` gradient line on KPI cards that fans out and glows on hover/active
  - Filter dropdowns: replaced jarring white `bg-white` selects with `.select-dark` (dark bg, accent focus ring)
  - DrillToggle: pill-shaped rounded control replacing rectangular box
  - Layer headers: left `2px` accent border + gradient background + numbered badges `01/02/03`
  - Chart panels: `.chart-panel` inset dark container (`#0a1522`) replacing flat `bg-navy-800`
  - Tooltips: backdrop-blur with accent border
  - Recharts: removed axis lines/tick lines, reduced grid opacity, set `maxBarSize`, `activeDot`
  - Geo map: inner glow on container, `drop-shadow` filter on accuracy markers, glow-dot legend
  - Active filter count badge in filter panel
- Built successfully (687KB, no errors)
- Committed and pushed → GitHub Actions deploying to gh-pages

**Also noted:** User asked to push after every update — will do going forward.
