# Design Choices — ISG SPoG ESG Forecasting Dashboard

A record of every significant design decision made, with the reasoning behind it.

---

## Visual Design

### Color Palette — Dark Navy Theme
**Decision:** Custom navy palette (`navy-900` → `navy-400`) with `#4fc3f7` accent.
```
navy-900: #0d1b2a  ← page background
navy-800: #112240  ← panel/section background
navy-700: #1a3456  ← filter bar, layer headers
navy-600: #1e3f6e  ← card bodies, chart backgrounds
navy-500: #2a5298  ← card headers
accent:   #4fc3f7  ← highlights, actuals bars, line charts
```
**Why:** Matches the dark navy theme shown in the PPT screenshots. Dark backgrounds reduce eye strain in ops-center environments and make colored chart data pop clearly.

### Typography
**Decision:** `'Segoe UI', system-ui, sans-serif` — no custom font loaded.
**Why:** Avoids a network request, matches Windows/Dell corporate environments, and renders crisply at small sizes (10–12px labels in chart axes).

### Text Size Strategy
- Filter labels: 10px uppercase tracking-wide
- Card titles: 11px bold
- Chart axis ticks: 9–10px
- Section headers: 12px bold uppercase
**Why:** Dense dashboard — space is at a premium. Labels need to be readable but not compete with chart data.

---

## Layout

### Three-column graph layout (all 3 visuals side by side)
**Decision:** Each graph layer renders its 3 visuals in a `flex gap-3` row.
**Why:** Directly mirrors the PPT design spec which shows Visual 1, 2, 3 side-by-side. Maximises horizontal screen real estate for comparison.

### Collapsible layers (accordion)
**Decision:** Each layer (1/2/3) has a clickable header that toggles content visibility.
**Why:** Lets users focus on one layer at a time. All 3 open simultaneously would be ~1200px tall and require constant scrolling.

### Filter panel — 2 rows × 6 columns (superseded 2026-07-01)
**Decision:** 12 filters laid out in a `grid-cols-6` grid inside the filter bar.
**Why:** Exactly matches the PPT screenshot layout (6 filters per row). Keeps the filter panel compact (two rows) so it doesn't eat into chart space.
**Update:** Replaced by the clustered filter bar below — the flat 6-per-row grid read as a generic BI slicer panel, which is exactly what the redesign was asked to move away from.

### Left-side section labels ("Cards", "Graphs")
**Decision:** Removed the vertical text labels from the PPT spec — not included in the UI.
**Why:** They were design-annotation labels in the spec document (for explaining the mockup to stakeholders), not actual UI elements. Including them would look odd in a real app.

## Component Decisions

### Filters lifted to App.jsx
**Decision:** `filters` state lives in `App`, passed down as props.
**Why:** All 3 layers + cards need to respond to the same filter state. Lifting to the nearest common ancestor avoids prop drilling through multiple layers and makes filter-to-data wiring straightforward when real data is connected.

### Drill-down as inline panel (not modal)
**Decision:** Clicking a KPI card opens a panel directly below the cards row, not a modal overlay.
**Why:** Modals interrupt workflow. An inline panel lets the user see both the card value and the detail table simultaneously without losing context of other cards.
**One deliberate exception (2026-07-01):** Clicking a year's bar inside the CQN Variance drill-down opens an actual modal (backdrop + centered card) listing that year's example queues. This is a second level of drill nested inside the first — by the time you're two levels deep, "context of the other cards" isn't the thing you're trying to preserve; a floating overlay reads more clearly than squeezing another chart into an already-open panel.
**Superseded (2026-07-02):** Requested directly for both pages — card drill-downs now open in the shared `Modal` (`src/components/Modal.jsx`), same as HES Forecasting. See "Card drill-downs: modal popups on the Forecasting page too" below. The CQN Variance year-click modal is unaffected (still its own nested overlay), it's just nested one level deeper now (a modal inside a modal) instead of a modal inside an inline panel.

### Drill toggle (FY / Quarter / Week) as segmented control (removed 2026-07-01)
**Decision:** Three-button segmented control per visual instead of a dropdown.
**Why:** Users switch frequently between fiscal granularities. One-click toggle is faster than open-select-close. The options are fixed (only 3), so a segmented control is appropriate.
**Update:** Removed once the top filter bar gained real Fiscal Year/Quarter/Week filters — having both a top-level time filter and a per-chart time toggle was a duplicate control surface. Layer 1/2 Visual 1 now always render at Fiscal Year granularity; the top filters (whichever is most specific) pick which year shows. The `.drill-toggle`/`.drill-btn` CSS classes weren't deleted — they're reused for the new DB/OSP segmented pill in the filter bar.

### Plan A / Plan B as separate dropdowns per visual
**Decision:** Each visual in Layer 1 has its own Plan A / Plan B selector.
**Why:** PPT spec explicitly states "2 dropdowns at the top right of each graph to select two different plans." Independent per-visual allows comparing different plan pairs across visuals simultaneously.

### Layer 2 Visual 2 — stacked bar (not grouped)
**Decision:** Stacked 100% bar chart showing adherence buckets (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor) per fiscal year.
**Why:** The PPT screenshot shows a stacked percentage chart (FY25/26/27 with % breakdowns like 43%/36%/9%/13%). Stacked format communicates the distribution of queues across performance tiers, which grouped bars would obscure.

### CQN chart orientation — horizontal bars
**Decision:** Visual 3 in both Layer 1 and Layer 2 uses a horizontal (layout="vertical") bar chart.
**Why:** Real queue names (e.g. `EMEA DPD AVAMAR`, `NAMER DPD DataDomain`) are long strings — they fit naturally on the Y axis. Vertical bars with queue names on the X axis would require angled labels and wasted space. YAxis width was widened to 130px (from the original CQN-code-era 58–60px) once real names replaced short placeholder codes.

---

## Chart Library

### Recharts (not Chart.js or Victory)
**Decision:** Recharts v2.12.
**Why:**
- Native React component model (no imperative canvas API)
- `ComposedChart` natively supports bars + lines on dual Y-axes — exactly what Plan vs Variance and Actual vs Adherence require
- Good TypeScript support, active maintenance
- Lighter than Victory, more customisable than nivo for this use case

### react-simple-maps (not Leaflet or Mapbox)
**Decision:** react-simple-maps v3 with world-atlas topojson from CDN.
**Why:**
- Pure SVG — no tile server, no API key, no map token required
- Lightweight and renders within the React tree
- `ComposableMap` + `Geographies` + `Marker` pattern is straightforward for dropping accuracy indicators on regions/countries
- Leaflet would add ~150KB and requires a separate CSS file + imperative setup

### Dual Y-axis on all ComposedCharts
**Decision:** Left Y-axis = volume (call counts), Right Y-axis = percentage (variance/adherence).
**Why:** Volume values (20K–300K) and percentage values (−10% to +10%) are on completely different scales. A single Y-axis would flatten the line into near-zero.

---

## Accuracy Color Scale (Geo Map)

| Range | Color | Label |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 90% | `#2e7d32` (dark green) | Excellent |
| 80–90% | `#1976d2` (blue) | Good |
| 70–80% | `#e65100` (orange) | Fair |
| < 70% | `#b71c1c` (dark red) | Critical |

**Why:** Traffic-light metaphor extended to 4 bands. Green/blue/orange/red maps intuitively to performance tiers. Blue for "Good" (not yellow) avoids green/yellow/red colorblindness issues (deuteranopia).

---

## CI/CD Design

### peaceiris/actions-gh-pages over actions/deploy-pages
**Decision:** Switched from `actions/configure-pages + actions/deploy-pages@v4` to `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`.
**Why:**
- `actions/deploy-pages` requires GitHub Pages to be set to "GitHub Actions" as source — this is a manual repo setting that isn't auto-applied when Pages was already configured to deploy from a branch
- `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` pushes the `dist/` output to a `gh-pages` branch, which works with the classic "Deploy from branch" Pages setup
- More predictable — the `gh-pages` branch is visible in the repo, easy to inspect and debug

### vite base = '/ISG-SPoG/'
**Decision:** Set `base: '/ISG-SPoG/'` in `vite.config.js`.
**Why:** GitHub Pages serves project sites (non-org/non-custom-domain) under `/<repo-name>/`. Without this base, all asset paths (`/assets/index.js`) resolve to the root domain and return 404.

## UI Overhaul (2026-06-30) — Changes Applied

### Font: Space Grotesk
**Decision:** Replaced `Segoe UI, system-ui` with Space Grotesk (Google Fonts, 300–700 weight range).
**Why:** Segoe UI is a neutral system font with no personality. Space Grotesk is geometric and slightly technical — it signals "data tool" without feeling cold. `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` applied globally so all numbers in tables and cards align in columns.

### Signature Element: Luminous Card Top-Edge Glow
**Decision:** CSS `::before` pseudo-element on every KPI card — a `linear-gradient(90deg, transparent, #38bdf8, transparent)` line at the top that fans out (left/right bounds expand) and increases opacity on hover; full-width with box-shadow glow when active.
**Why:** Operations dashboards need to communicate "this data is live". The glow treatment makes cards feel like illuminated data panels without adding animation overhead. It's the one memorable thing in the design — everything else is quiet.

### Filter Dropdowns: Dark `.select-dark`
**Decision:** Removed `bg-white text-gray-800` from filter selects. Created `.select-dark` CSS class: `background: #0c1929`, accent-colored SVG chevron, translucent border, focus ring.
**Why:** White dropdowns in a dark dashboard are a visual scream. This was the single biggest regression in the original design.

### Layer Headers: Accent Left-Border + Numbered Badges
**Decision:** Each layer has a `2px solid #38bdf8` left border, horizontal gradient background, and a colored number badge (`01` in accent blue, `02` in teal-green, `03` in orange).
**Why:** The original `Layer 1 / Layer 2 / Layer 3` labels had no visual weight. The numbered badge creates hierarchy and lets the eye navigate to sections quickly. Three different badge colors distinguish the layers at a glance.

### Chart Panels: `.chart-panel` Dark Inset
**Decision:** Chart visual containers now use `background: #0a1522` (darker than the layer surface) with `border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`.
**Why:** Creates visible depth — the layer container → chart panel → chart itself has three distinct tonal levels. Charts no longer float on flat surfaces.

### Pill DrillToggle
**Decision:** FY/Quarter/Week segmented control changed from rectangular box buttons to a pill container with rounded buttons. Active state: `background: #38bdf8; color: #070f1a`.
**Why:** The rectangle toggle had no roundness and looked like a table row. The pill form is a standard pattern for mutually-exclusive quick filters and reads as interactive at a glance.

### Recharts Axis Cleanup
**Decision:** Removed `axisLine` and `tickLine` from all XAxis/YAxis. Reduced CartesianGrid to `rgba(255,255,255,0.05)` strokeDasharray `2 4`. Added `maxBarSize` cap on all bars.
**Why:** Axis lines double-draw the chart border and add visual noise. With a dark background, tick marks alone are sufficient for reference. Capping bar size prevents bars from becoming wall-to-wall at low data counts.

### Tooltip: Backdrop Blur + Accent Border
**Decision:** `.chart-tooltip` uses `backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`, `background: rgba(12,25,41,0.96)`, `border: 1px solid rgba(56,189,248,0.25)`.
**Why:** Glassmorphism on the tooltip keeps it legible without completely blocking the chart behind it. The accent border connects it visually to the hovered data point.

### Geo Map Marker Glow
**Decision:** SVG `filter: drop-shadow(0 0 6px <color>)` on each accuracy circle, with glow intensity matching the accuracy color (green/blue/orange/red).
**Why:** Plain colored circles on a dark map are hard to find at small sizes. The drop-shadow creates a halo that draws the eye to marker locations without requiring larger circles.

## Filter Bar Redesign & Live Filtering (2026-07-01)

### Clustered filter bar, not a flat dropdown grid
**Decision:** Regrouped the 12 filters into 4 icon-labeled clusters — Scope (Queue Name, Capacity Code, Plan Name), Time (Fiscal Year/Quarter/Week), People (Channel, Business Partner, L5 Manager), Geography (Region, Sub-region, DB/OSP) — with a thin accent-gradient divider between the two clusters on each row, and a small inline icon (stack / clock / person / globe) per cluster instead of one generic filter icon for the whole bar.
**Why:** The brief explicitly asked for something that doesn't read as generic BI slicers. A wall of 12 identical dropdown boxes is exactly that; grouping by what the filter actually answers (what/when/who/where) gives the bar real structure instead of decoration, and the icons let the eye chunk the bar without reading every label.

### Underline-tab select styling instead of bordered boxes
**Decision:** `.select-dark` dropped its full border/box background for a nearly-transparent field with a bottom accent underline that only lights up on hover/focus (`border-bottom` from `rgba(255,255,255,0.09)` to `#38bdf8`), plus a softer custom chevron.
**Why:** Boxed dropdowns in a row are the single most recognizable "BI slicer panel" signature. An underline-tab treatment reads as a quiet, integrated control — closer to how a native ops console treats inputs.
**Update (2026-07-01):** The 11 non-DB/OSP filters are no longer native `<select>` elements — see "Searchable multi-select filters" below — but `.ms-field` carries the exact same underline-tab visual treatment, so the look didn't change, only the interaction model underneath it.

### Searchable multi-select filters (2026-07-01)
**Decision:** Built a custom `MultiSelectField` (button + popover: search box, "Select all"/"Clear", checkbox list, native `accent-color` checkboxes) to replace every native `<select>` except the DB/OSP pill.
**Why:** Queue Name (199 options) and Capacity Code (~610) were unusable as plain dropdowns — no way to search, no way to pick more than one. A checkbox-list-with-search is structurally what Power BI's slicer does too, but the mechanism being similar doesn't make it wrong; the execution is what was asked to differ (dark glass panel, accent glow border, underline-tab trigger matching the rest of the bar) rather than the interaction pattern itself, which is the correct tool for "search + multi-select" regardless of what tool popularized it.
**Consequence:** Every filter value became an array (`[]` = no selection = "All") except `dbOsp`, which stayed a single string since the pill is a 3-way exclusive control, not a search-and-multi-select case. `mockData.js`'s `matchesMulti()` helper and `effectiveFiscalYears()` (renamed from the old singular `effectiveFiscalYear`) are the seams where every chart/card selector adapted to array-valued filters.

### Monospace font for Queue Name & Capacity Code values
**Decision:** Those two fields render in a system monospace stack; every other filter stays in Space Grotesk.
**Why:** They're literal system codes (`AM02`, `EMEA DPD AVAMAR`), not prose — the drill-down table already used monospace for queue names (see Layer 3 CQN tables). Extending that convention to the filter itself makes "this is a code" legible at a glance, and costs no extra font request since it's a system stack, not a webfont.

### DB/OSP as a segmented pill, not a third binary dropdown
**Decision:** Reused the existing `.drill-toggle`/`.drill-btn` pill pattern (freed up once the per-chart FY/Quarter/Week toggle was removed) for DB/OSP/All.
**Why:** It's a 3-option exclusive choice — a dropdown for that is more clicks than it needs to be, and the pill pattern was already proven elsewhere in the app. Reusing it is more coherent than inventing a second toggle style.

### Applied-filter chip strip (the signature element)
**Decision:** Once any filter is off "All", a "Scoped by" strip appears below the filter bar — one glowing chip per active filter (`Label: Value ×`), plus "Clear all". Uses the same accent-glow language as the KPI cards' top-edge signature (glow intensifies on hover).
**Why:** This is the one thing a Power BI-style slicer panel doesn't have: a persistent, at-a-glance answer to "what is this view currently scoped to?" Real ops dashboards (Datadog, Grafana) surface active scope as removable tags for exactly this reason — it turns 12 independent dropdowns into one coherent "current view" statement, and it doubles as the fastest way to back out of a filter without hunting for which dropdown you changed.

### Live filtering via a queue fact table, not per-chart special cases
**Decision:** `ACTIVE_QUEUES` became a fact table — every queue carries region, sub-region, capacity code, business partner, L5 manager, channel, and DB/OSP tags. `filterQueues(filters)` is the single function every card and CQN-variance chart calls; `cardData(filters)`, `cqnPlanVariance(filters)`, `cqnActualVariance(filters)` all sit on top of it.
**Why:** The brief asked for every filter to visibly affect the graphs. Faking that per-chart with unrelated random scaling would look plausible but be dishonest math. A shared fact table means every filter's effect is a real re-aggregation (a real count, a real average, a real top-N) — slower to build than a fudge factor, but the numbers on screen are always literally true given the mock tags.

### DB/OSP scopes volume, not queue-portfolio membership
**Decision:** Total Queues / Forecast Accuracy / CQN Variance / both CQN-variance charts filter on 7 of the 8 queue dimensions but explicitly ignore DB/OSP; Call Volume / DB-OSP Split respect it.
**Why:** The app's default filter state has always been `dbOsp: 'DB'` (pre-existing, not new). Once filtering became real, that default was silently shrinking "Total Queues" from 199 to ~132 on first load — a queue's existence and accuracy don't depend on which slice of its call volume you're viewing, so that default shouldn't touch portfolio-level metrics. Caught by screenshotting the live app during verification, not by inspection.

## Chart Redesign, Geo Choropleth, RCA/CLCA Sidebar (2026-07-01)

### Centered chart titles
**Decision:** Every chart panel's title moved from a left-aligned row shared with its controls to its own centered row at the top; controls (plan pickers) moved to a second, also-centered row underneath.
**Why:** Directly requested. A left-aligned title fighting for space with right-aligned dropdowns reads as "the title lost a negotiation with the toolbar" — centering the title on its own line gives it clear top billing and reads as a proper chart heading rather than a form-field label.

### Diverging bar chart instead of two adjacent bars (CQN variance)
**Decision:** Both "CQN Highest Variance" charts (renamed "Top Queue Variance") now render one bar per queue — the variance itself — extending right (green) or left (red) from a zero baseline, instead of two side-by-side bars (Plan A vs Plan B, or Actual vs Plan) the reader had to compare by eye.
**Why:** The two-bars-per-queue version made the reader do the subtraction mentally for every row; a diverging bar shows the answer (the gap) directly, and the color does double duty as both a legend and a "good/bad" signal. This is the single biggest visualization upgrade in this pass — everything else here is refinement, this changed what the chart is actually plotting.
**Follow-up (2026-07-02):** First pass still wasn't reading well — every bar in a given "top-5 by magnitude" pull tends to cluster near the same value (see next entry), so bars looked nearly identical with nothing to visually latch onto. Added a value label at the end of each bar (`+7%`/`-7%`, colored to match) so the exact number is always visible regardless of how similar the bars look, split into two `LabelList`s using Recharts' own `position="left"`/`"right"` (a hand-computed `x`/`width` version drifted the label into the bar interior — Recharts' built-in positioning is more reliable than re-deriving bar geometry). Also rounded the axis domain/ticks to clean 5%-step values instead of whatever odd number the raw max happened to produce, and widened + smartened the queue-name truncation (breaks at the last word boundary instead of mid-word).

### Reserving color semantics: violet for neutral trends, green/red for ahead/behind
**Decision:** The Fiscal Year / Regional Plan Variance line moved from red (`#f87171`) to violet (`#a78bfa`); green/red are now used exclusively on the diverging bar charts to mean ahead-of-plan/behind-plan.
**Why:** A trend line showing "variance %" isn't inherently good or bad by itself (that judgment depends on direction and magnitude together) — coloring it red implied "this is bad" regardless of value. Freeing red for its one true job (behind plan) and giving neutral analytical lines their own color makes the color vocabulary consistent across every chart: if it's red, something is behind; nothing else claims that color.

### Forecast Variance Distribution: re-bucketed by magnitude, not accuracy tier, with data labels
**Decision:** Replaced the ≥90%/80–90%/70–80%/<70% accuracy-tier buckets with <10%/10–20%/20–30%/>30% variance-magnitude buckets, a green→blue→amber→red graduated scale, and a `LabelList` printing each segment's % directly on the bar.
**Why:** Requested directly, and it's a clearer story either way — "how far off plan is this population" (variance magnitude) is a more actionable framing for a forecasting dashboard than "what tier is this population in" (accuracy tier), and printing the value on the segment means a reader doesn't have to eyeball stacked-bar heights against the Y-axis to know a number.

### Geo Map: choropleth instead of circle markers, Sub-region instead of Country
**Decision:** Removed all `<Marker>` circles; every country `<Geography>` is now filled by its region's (or sub-region's) accuracy color directly. The Country/Region toggle became Sub-region/Region, backed by the real 24 `SUB_REGIONS` values instead of a hardcoded 14-country list.
**Why:** Requested directly — "highlight the geography... as green" is a choropleth by definition, and circles sitting on top of an otherwise-flat map don't communicate "this whole area is this color" the way a filled shape does. Sub-region replacing Country also makes the drill-down consistent with the filter bar, which already has a real "Sub-region" filter with real values.

### Illustrative country→region/sub-region mapping, with a dimmed regional fallback in Sub-region view
**Decision:** `regionForCountry()`/`subRegionForCountry()` in `mockData.js` are a hand-built, clearly-labeled-as-illustrative mapping (e.g., "ROLA" → Argentina/Chile/Colombia/Peru/etc.), not authoritative geography or real org data. In Sub-region view, a country with no specific sub-region tag falls back to its parent region's accuracy at 35% opacity, so the whole map is covered but named sub-regions still visually "pop" at full opacity against the dimmed background.
**Why:** Several real sub-region values (ROLA, UKI, CER, SER, Nordics, EC) are groups of countries, not single places, and there's no authoritative per-country mapping in the source data — so a full-coverage choropleth necessarily means inventing *some* grouping. Doing it once, explicitly, and labeling it as illustrative is more honest than leaving large parts of the map uncolored (which reads as "no data" when really it's "no specific sub-region tag") or silently treating a guess as real business data.

### RCA/CLCA as a persistent full-height sidebar, not a new section
**Decision:** `RcaClcaPanel.jsx` sits in a `position: sticky` right-hand column alongside the KPI cards and all three analysis layers, not inside or after any single layer.
**Why:** "On the right side of the dashboard" reads as the whole page, not one section — a sidebar that only sat next to the Geo Map would orphan it from the cards and the other two layers above. Sticky positioning means it stays visible as the (much taller) left column scrolls, which matters for a panel meant to be read alongside whatever chart is currently in view.
**Adjusted (2026-07-02):** Moved to start at the "Analysis Layers" divider instead of "Key Metrics" — the 5 KPI cards now span the full page width on their own row, and the sidebar only runs alongside Layers 1–3. Full-width cards read better than 5 cards squeezed to make room for a sidebar that, at that point, has nothing yet to say about any specific chart the user is looking at.

### Chart titles renamed to match their section's own naming
**Decision:** Layer 1 Visual 1 ("Fiscal Year Plan Variance") → **PoP Variation**; Layer 2 Visual 1 ("Fiscal Year Adherence") → **Actual vs Plan Variation**.
**Why:** Requested directly. Both new names echo their parent layer's own title (Layer 1 = "Plan over Plan" → PoP; Layer 2 = "Actual vs Plan" → Actual vs Plan Variation), which reads as more intentional than a generic "Fiscal Year X" pattern repeated across both layers.

## HES Forecasting: New Page via Header Toggle (2026-07-02)

### Page toggle, not a route
**Decision:** `App.jsx` holds a single `page` state ('forecasting'|'hes') and renders `ForecastingPage` or `HesForecastingPage` — no router, no URL change.
**Why:** The app has always been a single internal tool with no need for shareable/bookmarkable URLs per page, and adding React Router for two pages would be new infrastructure for no real benefit. The existing `.drill-toggle`/`.drill-btn` pill pattern already reads as "switch between two views" everywhere else in the app, so reusing it for page-level navigation is more consistent than introducing a new nav pattern.

### ForecastingPage extracted verbatim, not rewritten
**Decision:** The entire pre-existing `App.jsx` body (filters through footer-adjacent content) moved into `ForecastingPage.jsx` unchanged; `App.jsx` became a shell with just the header, toggle, and footer.
**Why:** The Forecasting page was just declared "done" — extracting it verbatim guarantees zero visual or behavioral regression while making room for a second page. Splitting `SectionDivider` out separately (rather than duplicating it into `hes/`) means both pages share one implementation of the "KEY METRICS" / "ANALYSIS LAYERS" label.

### Built directly from confirmed slides, no further data requests mid-build
**Decision:** Once the user said "just build the page over these two slides" (slides 5–6, ASU/SR/UCR), the page was built with reasonable illustrative choices for anything not explicitly supplied (LOB→region-plan mapping, UCR targets, ASU/SR base volumes), rather than pausing again to ask for every missing number.
**Why:** The user explicitly asked to proceed rather than wait — matching the same "real names + illustrative structure" principle already established for the ESG Forecasting page (see below), just applied to a new dataset. Real data supplied mid-build (the 33 LOB names, the HES queue lists) was integrated immediately rather than deferred.

### No RCA/CLCA sidebar on HES Forecasting
**Decision:** `RcaClcaPanel` only renders on the ESG Forecasting page; HES Forecasting's 4 layers run full-width with no sidebar.
**Why:** The sidebar's actual content (RCA/CLCA findings) is ESG-Forecasting-specific illustrative copy tied to that page's metrics — copying it verbatim onto a page about ASU/SR/UCR would be visibly wrong content, and the ASU/SR/UCR slides never showed an equivalent panel. If the user wants an HES-specific RCA/CLCA sidebar later, it should get its own content, not a reused copy.
**Update (2026-07-02):** Requested directly — see "HES-specific RCA/CLCA sidebar content" below. `HesRcaClcaPanel.jsx` now provides that page-specific content, following exactly the plan already laid out in this entry.

### Renamed "ESG Capacity Planning" → "HES Forecasting" (2026-07-02, same day)
**Decision:** Renamed the page label, every component/file/folder (`capacity/` → `hes/`, `CapacityPlanningPage.jsx` → `HesForecastingPage.jsx`, `CapacityFilterPanel.jsx` → `HesFilterPanel.jsx`, `CapacityChartKit.jsx` → `HesChartKit.jsx`, `CapacityMetricCards.jsx` → `HesMetricCards.jsx`, `CapacityGeoMap.jsx` → `HesGeoMap.jsx`, `capacityData.js` → `hesData.js`), and every internal identifier that carried "capacity" in its name (`capacityCardData` → `hesCardData`, `capacityEffectiveFiscalYears` → `hesEffectiveFiscalYears`), via `git mv` to preserve file history.
**Why:** Requested directly. The page is fundamentally about HES (High End Storage) service-unit tracking, not a general capacity-planning concept — "HES Forecasting" names what the page actually is. Renamed identifiers and files along with the label, not just the visible string, so the codebase doesn't end up with a page called "HES Forecasting" built out of files and functions still named "Capacity" — that mismatch would confuse the next person (or agent) who opens the folder. The pre-existing "Capacity Code" filter field on the *ESG Forecasting* page (a real queue attribute, unrelated to this page) was deliberately left untouched — it's a different concept that happens to share a word.

### LOB filter reuses the Queue Name filter's real-data-swap pattern
**Decision:** `ucrNonAdherentQueues(filters)` checks whether the selected LOB has a `LOB_QUEUES` entry (currently only "High End Storage") and swaps to its real active-queue list when so, exactly like `cqnPlanVariance`/`cqnActualVariance` on the Forecasting page swap to genuinely filtered real queues rather than fabricating a new number per filter state.
**Why:** Consistent with the standing principle: when real data exists for a slice of the view, use it exactly; when it doesn't (every other LOB), fall back to a clearly-mock but structurally-consistent substitute rather than inventing fake per-LOB queue names.

### Region/LOB delta formula: coprime multiplier instead of a small modulus
**Decision:** `buildLobImpact()`'s per-LOB delta uses `(i*17 + ri*41) % 131` instead of the original `(i*7 + ri*13) % 21`.
**Why:** Caught during Playwright verification — the original formula's modulus (21) was small enough relative to its multiplier (7, sharing a factor of 7 with 21) that only 3 distinct residues existed, so 6+ different LOBs displayed an identical delta in the "Plan Impact Analysis" drill-down list, which looked obviously fake once several rows in a row read `-2400`. A modulus that's prime (131) paired with a coprime multiplier (17) guarantees every one of the 33 LOBs maps to a distinct residue for a fixed region — still fully deterministic mock data, just varied enough to not visually expose itself as a repeating pattern.

## HES Forecasting: Total Queues Card + RCA/CLCA Sidebar (2026-07-02)

### Total Queues card replaces UCR Impacted SR, front of the row
**Decision:** Removed the "UCR Impacted SR" card (previously last) and added a "Total Queues" card at the front of the Key Metrics row, styled and worded identically to the Forecasting page's Total Queues card (`⬡` icon, "Active / Inactive" sublabel, `active / total` value, "N inactive queues" sub-line).
**Why:** Requested directly ("remove the UCR card from the last and the front add the total queues card similarly we did for ESG Forecasting"). Matching the Forecasting page's exact wording/format makes the two pages read as the same product rather than two dashboards with similar-but-different conventions for the same concept.

### `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']` reused as the page-level queue roster, not one LOB's sample
**Decision:** `HES_ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES`/`HES_INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` (new in `hesData.js`) point at the same real 71 active / ~150 inactive names already in `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']`, but the Total Queues card treats them as the whole page's queue count, not filtered to that one LOB.
**Why:** The user said "I have already given you a list of active and inactive queues for HES" — referring to the only real per-queue name lists this page has. Treating them as LOB-scoped (the original framing when they were first added, for the UCR non-adherent-queue drill-down) would leave the Total Queues card with no real numbers to show for the other 32 LOBs; treating them as the page's queue roster uses real, business-supplied data honestly instead of inventing placeholder counts for LOBs with no real queue data. Flagged in `handoff.md`/`tech_spec.md` as a decision to revisit if real per-LOB queue lists arrive later.

### Region tagging via `inferRegion()`, reused rather than re-implemented
**Decision:** Exported `inferRegion()` from `mockData.js` (was file-local) and reused it in `hesData.js` to tag each HES active queue name with a region for the Total Queues donut.
**Why:** The HES queue names follow the exact same prefix convention (`APJ …`, `EMEA …`, `NAMER …`, `LATAM …`, else `Global`) as the Forecasting page's queue names — writing a second, near-identical region-inference function would just be the same regex copy-pasted under a new name.

### Total Queues drill-down: same donut-then-table mechanic, minus the Accuracy column
**Decision:** Mirrored the Forecasting page's `QueuesByRegionChart` + `QueueTable` almost verbatim (click a slice or legend entry to filter the table to that region, "Clear" to reset) but dropped the Accuracy column from the table.
**Why:** Requested directly ("drilldown should be similar pie chart we did for ESG Forecasting"). Accuracy is a forecast-quality concept tied to ESG Forecasting's plan/actual data; HES queues in this list have no equivalent real metric, so showing a column here would mean fabricating a number just to look consistent — Queue + Region is the honest subset of that pattern.

### HES-specific RCA/CLCA sidebar content, not a copy of the Forecasting page's
**Decision:** New `HesRcaClcaPanel.jsx`, wired into `HesForecastingPage.jsx` with the identical sticky-sidebar-next-to-Analysis-Layers layout as `RcaClcaPanel`/`ForecastingPage.jsx`, but with its own illustrative findings written in this page's own vocabulary (ASU/SR/CPASU/UCR/LOB) instead of reusing the Forecasting page's queue/call-volume-themed copy.
**Why:** Requested directly ("add RCA and CLCA section similarly we did for ESG Forecasting") — "similarly" was read as *same mechanism and layout*, not *same words*, consistent with the standing decision already on record in this file ("No RCA/CLCA sidebar on HES Forecasting... If the user wants an HES-specific RCA/CLCA sidebar later, it should get its own content, not a reused copy").

## HES Forecasting: Card Modals, Renames, Layer 3 Redesign (2026-07-02)

### Card drill-downs: modal popups, not inline panels (HES Forecasting only)
**Decision:** `HesMetricCards.jsx`'s 5 card drill-downs moved from an inline panel below the cards row to a centered modal (new `Modal` in `HesChartKit.jsx`), closable via backdrop click or ✕.
**Why:** Requested directly — "display the detailed view as a popup modal instead of navigating to a new page... allow users to close it and return to the dashboard without losing their current filter selections." This deliberately diverges from the Forecasting page's "no modals except the CQN Variance year-click" rule (see "Drill-down as inline panel" above) — that rule described an established pattern for *that* page; this request is explicit and scoped to HES Forecasting's cards, so it doesn't retroactively apply elsewhere. Filters live one level up in `HesForecastingPage`, so opening/closing the modal never touches them — closing always returns to the dashboard exactly as filtered.

### YTD message replaces "Plan X · Y% adherence" on ASU/SR/CPASU cards
**Decision:** `hesCardData()` now computes a year-over-year % delta (`yoyPct`) for ASU, SR, and CPASU — latest in-scope FY vs the one before it. The card sub-line reads `YTD <FY>: <value> · ▲/▼ X% vs <prior FY>`, with a colored status pip.
**Why:** Requested directly ("add a YTD message... show increase/decrease as per your wish"). CPASU inverts the color logic (`lowerIsBetter`) since a falling CPASU is the desirable direction, consistent with the card's existing "lower is more efficient" framing — ASU/SR keep growth-is-good coloring. When filters narrow to a single FY there's no prior year to compare, so the message falls back to "no prior year in scope" rather than a misleading 0%.

### SR Actuals popup: grouped columns instead of stacked bar
**Decision:** Removed `stackId` from the DB/OSP bars in the SR Actuals drill-down chart.
**Why:** Requested directly.

### CPASU popup: line-only instead of Composed (bars + line)
**Decision:** Dropped the SR/ASU bars from the CPASU card's popup, leaving a single `LineChart` of CPASU across fiscal years.
**Why:** Requested directly ("show a line chart... showing only the CPASU over years").

### Plan Impact: 4-region set (AMER/APJ/EMEA/Global) replaces the deck's 3-region set
**Decision:** `IMPACT_REGIONS` changed from `['NAMER','EMEA','APJ']` to `['AMER','APJ','EMEA','Global']`.
**Why:** Requested directly for both ASU Layer's and SR Layer's Plan Impact visuals. Reused the same constant for CPASU Trend's region breakdown (below) instead of introducing a second region list — one 4-region set for every region-scoped HES visual is more coherent than two overlapping ones.

### CPASU Trend: regions-by-default, click-to-drill into time granularity
**Decision:** Replaced the Region/Country toggle on "ASU Impact on SR Trend with CPASU" (renamed **CPASU Trend**) with a region-default view — grouped ASU/SR bars + CPASU line, one group per `IMPACT_REGIONS` entry. Clicking a region's bar drills into that region's own trend, rendered at whichever of Week/Quarter/Year is most specific in the top filter bar (`regionTrendGranularity()`), with a "← All Regions" pill to back out.
**Why:** Requested directly — "show the regions as default and when we click any particular region it should show up the year or quarter or week when selected from the filters at the top." No real per-region/per-quarter/per-week dataset exists, so `cpasuTrendByRegion()` synthesizes it deterministically from the same FY baselines used everywhere else on this page (documented as illustrative in `tech_spec.md`) — dividing each FY's baseline across the periods within it, rather than inventing an unrelated dataset or silently ignoring the requested drill.

### UCR Impact on SR: renamed series, added a (cosmetic) Plan selector in the corner
**Decision:** "SR (Human)" → **SR's**, "SR (Bots)" → **UCR Handled SR's**. Added a `PlanSelect` in the visual's top-right corner via a new `cornerControls` slot on `Visual` (`HesChartKit.jsx`), positioned absolutely instead of the usual centered-below-title `controls` row.
**Why:** Both requested directly, including the specific "top right corner" placement — a deliberate one-off exception to the page's usual centered-controls convention (see "Centered chart titles" above) because the request was explicit about the corner rather than a stylistic default. The selector doesn't yet feed into `srBotsByFY()`'s output, matching the existing precedent of AsuLayer/SrLayer Visual1's Plan dropdown, which is also not yet wired to the underlying numbers.

### UCR Runrate with Target: fixed at fiscal-year granularity, top-5-LOB modal replaces the queue list
**Decision:** The chart now always plots `UCR_BY_FY` directly (all 3 fiscal years), ignoring Quarter/Week filter narrowing. The previously always-visible "queues not adhering to target" list is gone; clicking a year's bar opens a modal listing that year's top 5 non-adherent **LOBs** (not queues), via new selector `topNonAdherentLobsByYear()`.
**Why:** Requested directly ("keep it at fiscal year default", "top 5 LOB's not adhering... give a pop-up (design on your convenience)"). Modal-on-bar-click for a "top N" list directly mirrors the CQN Variance year-click modal already established on the Forecasting page — reusing a proven pattern rather than inventing a new one from scratch. Switching from queues to LOBs left `LOB_QUEUES`'s real per-queue data (High End Storage) without a UI consumer for now — see `handoff.md` and `tech_spec.md`'s Known Limitations.

---

## Card Drill-Downs: Modal Popups on the Forecasting Page Too (2026-07-02)

### Shared `Modal` component, extracted to `src/components/Modal.jsx`
**Decision:** The `Modal` popup originally built for HES Forecasting's cards (`src/components/hes/HesChartKit.jsx`) moved to a top-level `src/components/Modal.jsx`; `HesChartKit.jsx` now re-exports it (`export { Modal } from '../Modal'`) so every existing HES import keeps working unchanged. `MetricCards.jsx` imports it directly.
**Why:** The request was to give the Forecasting page's cards the exact same modal behavior HES Forecasting already has — reusing the one implementation both pages now need is more honest than copy-pasting the same ~30 lines of overlay markup into a second file, and guarantees the two pages' modals stay visually identical as either evolves.

### Forecasting page's card drill-downs: inline panel → modal
**Decision:** `MetricCards.jsx`'s `DrillDownPanel` (rendered inline below the cards row) became `DrillDownModal`, wrapped in the shared `Modal`. The nested `YearQueueModal` (CQN Variance's year-click drill) is unchanged — it's now a modal nested inside a modal instead of a modal nested inside an inline panel, but its own implementation and behavior didn't need to change.
**Why:** Requested directly, explicitly extended to "do this for ESG Forecasting as well" after HES Forecasting got the same treatment. This supersedes the page's original "Drill-down as inline panel (not modal)" decision (see above) — closing the modal only clears `MetricCards`' local `active` state, so `filters` (owned by `ForecastingPage`) is never touched, meaning the dashboard is exactly as filtered when the modal closes, matching the "without losing current filter selections" requirement.

---

## ESG Forecasting: Corrected Queue Roster (2026-07-02)

### Replace the arrays wholesale, not merge/append
**Decision:** `ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` and `INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` in `mockData.js` were fully replaced with the newly business-supplied lists (47 active, 146 inactive), rather than merged with the prior 199/406 names.
**Why:** The new lists were explicitly labeled "for ESG Forecasting... update accordingly," and cross-checking showed every name in both new lists already existed somewhere in the old lists (the new active list is a subset of the old active list; the new inactive list is a subset of the old inactive list, plus `'CCC MidRange Mandarin'` moved over from active) — this reads as a corrected, pruned roster the business wants reflected exactly, not an addition to what was already there. Merging would have kept ~350+ names the correction was meant to drop.
**Verified before applying:** scripted checks (not manual eyeballing) confirmed no duplicate names within either new list and no overlap between the two new lists, since a name appearing in both would silently break `filterQueues`'s assumption that a queue is either active or inactive, never both.

### No code changes needed — the pipeline was already count-agnostic
**Decision:** Only the two array literals changed; `filterQueues`, `callVolumeByFY`, `dbOspVolumeByFY`, `cardData`, and the CQN-variance selectors were left untouched.
**Why:** Every one of those functions already reads `ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES.length` or `ACTIVE_QUEUES.length` dynamically rather than a hardcoded `199` — a queue-count change is exactly the kind of update this data model was built to absorb without a code change. This is also why the Call Volume/DB-OSP baseline totals (285.4K/268.7K) didn't need touching: they scale by a ratio (`filtered / total active`) that's still 1.0 with no filters applied, regardless of how many rows are on each side of that ratio.

## Filter Bar Gap Fix + Light/Dark Theme Toggle (2026-07-02)

### HES filter bar gap: match the Forecasting page's already-correct flex pattern
**Decision:** Added `flex-1 min-w-0` to `HesFilterPanel.jsx`'s `Cluster` grid div, mirroring `FilterPanel.jsx`'s `Cluster` (`className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-x-3 flex-1 min-w-0"`).
**Why:** The Time cluster's outer wrapper correctly received extra width via `flex: 4 4 0`, but the grid div inside it — a plain flex child with no `flex-grow` of its own — doesn't inherit that width automatically; it sizes to its own content and leaves the parent's allocated-but-unclaimed space as a visible gap before the next cluster. The Forecasting page's filter bar never had this bug because its `Cluster` already included the class; HES's was written slightly differently when the page was first built and missed it.

### CSS custom properties, not a second stylesheet or a CSS-in-JS library
**Decision:** Theme values live as CSS custom properties in `:root` (dark) and `[data-theme='light']` (`src/index.css`), toggled by setting a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. No new dependency, no duplicated stylesheet, no per-component theme prop drilling.
**Why:** Every shared visual "chrome" class (`.card-panel`, `.chart-panel`, `.select-dark`, etc.) already lived in one CSS file — swapping their hardcoded hex for `var(--token)` and adding one override block gets both pages reskinned from a single source of truth. Persisting the choice to `localStorage` and applying the attribute inside `App.jsx`'s `useState` initializer (not a `useEffect`) avoids a flash of the wrong theme on load, since it runs before first paint.

### Chart/data colors stay constant across themes; only "chrome" switches
**Decision:** Backgrounds, borders, and primary/secondary/muted/faint text all reroute through theme variables. Chart series colors (the blue/orange/violet role assignments), the ahead/red-behind convention, region color palettes, the geo accuracy color scale (green/blue/orange/red), status badges, and the "01/02/03/04" layer-number badges keep their exact literal hex in both themes.
**Why:** These are meaningful data-encoding colors, not decoration — the same convention most ops dashboards (Grafana, Datadog) use: light/dark mode changes the canvas, not what a color *means*. Re-deriving the whole data palette per theme would risk breaking the "if it's red, something is behind plan" vocabulary established across both pages' design history, for a benefit (perfect light-mode chart hues) that doesn't materially help readability — every one of these colors already has enough contrast against both a near-white and a navy background.

### Geo maps keep an always-dark canvas regardless of theme
**Decision:** `Layer3GeoMap.jsx` and `HesGeoMap.jsx`'s map container (background, `DEFAULT_FILL`, country stroke/fill, the bottom accuracy-scale gradient, and the "no data" empty-state text) stay hardcoded dark in both themes. Only the chrome *around* the map (layer header, legend, summary table, the floating hover tooltip) follows the theme.
**Why:** A choropleth's fill colors are calibrated against a specific backdrop — flipping the canvas to white would wash out `DEFAULT_FILL` (the "no data" gray) and change how the accuracy colors read, without a proportional benefit. Keeping the map itself a dark "instrument panel" is a common pattern for embedded map/geo visuals regardless of host UI theme (weather widgets, ops dashboards). The floating hover tooltip is a separate element using the shared `.chart-tooltip` class, so it still re-themes correctly even though it sits visually on top of the fixed-dark map.

### `--accent` itself changes value between themes, with a paired `--accent-contrast`
**Decision:** `--accent` is `#38bdf8` (bright sky blue) in dark mode but `#0284c7` (a deeper, more saturated blue) in light mode; a separate `--accent-contrast` token (`#070f1a` dark / `#ffffff` light) is used wherever text sits *on top of* a solid accent fill (e.g. the active pill-toggle state).
**Why:** `#38bdf8` directly on a near-white page background has poor text contrast (it's barely darker than white) — the sun/moon toggle's own label color, `SectionDivider`'s "ANALYSIS LAYERS" label, and similar accent-as-text usages needed a deeper blue in light mode to stay legible. But that same deeper blue needs light text on top of it (not the dark navy text that works against the *bright* dark-mode accent) — hence the separate contrast token instead of a single hardcoded value.

## Global Time-Granularity Toggle: Quarter/Month/Week for Both Pages (2026-07-02)

### Placement: inside the filter bar, top-right, not a separate control or the header
**Decision:** The View By pill sits in the filter bar itself — same row as the value-filter clusters, after a divider, right-aligned (it ends up there naturally: the clusters' `flex-grow` consumes whatever width the fixed-size pill doesn't need, so no extra positioning trick was required).
**Why:** Researched before building (per the request) — dashboard UX guidance on filter placement says page-wide filters belong in a horizontal filter bar or toolbar rather than scattered per-widget, and time-granularity/date-range controls specifically are conventionally placed prominently and persistently near the other filters, often paired with a date-range picker. That argued against two alternatives considered: the app header (reserved for page-level chrome like the ESG/HES toggle and the light/dark switch — a different category of setting, not a data view control) and a brand-new toolbar row of its own (adds UI surface for one control when the existing filter bar already is the page's "toolbar"). Sources: [Pencil & Paper — Filter UX Design Patterns](https://www.pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-enterprise-filtering), [Pencil & Paper — Dashboard Design UX Patterns](https://www.pencilandpaper.io/articles/ux-pattern-analysis-data-dashboards), [Evolving Web — Date Filter UI Patterns](https://evolvingweb.com/blog/most-popular-date-filter-ui-patterns-and-how-decide-each-one).

### A view setting, not a value filter — visually distinct despite sharing the bar
**Decision:** The toggle uses the existing `.drill-toggle`/`.drill-btn` pill styling (already established for DB/OSP, the ESG/HES page switch, and the light/dark toggle) rather than a `MultiSelectField`, and is labeled "View By" rather than "Granularity" or a plain filter name.
**Why:** It changes *how* every time-axis chart renders (what granularity its x-axis uses), not *which rows are in scope* — a fundamentally different kind of control than the other 7-12 filters in the bar, even though it lives in the same row. Reusing the pill pattern (rather than a new widget) keeps it visually consistent with the app's other pill toggles instead of introducing a fourth control style.

### No option selected by default (corrected same day)
**Decision:** Unlike the DB/OSP pill (always exactly one of DB/OSP/All active, no "off" state), the View By pill starts with none of Quarter/Month/Week highlighted, and clicking the currently-active option deselects it back to that default. `granularity` state defaults to `null`, not `'Quarter'`.
**Why:** Shipped defaulting to `'Quarter'` first, which changed every chart's out-of-the-box look (12 quarterly bars instead of the original 3 fiscal-year bars) — caught immediately when the user compared against the dashboard's established default. The correct default is "no selection," matching how every value filter in the bar already defaults to "All" rather than a pre-picked value; "no selection = Fiscal Year" keeps that same convention instead of inventing a fourth granularity concept. This also exposed a latent bug: `regionTrendGranularity()`'s `= 'Quarter'` default *parameter* only fires when the argument is omitted, not when it's explicitly `null` — since the real caller always passes the toggle's actual value now (including `null`), that default silently never engaged, and `null` fell through to the Quarter branch anyway. Fixed by checking for falsy/`'Year'` explicitly and returning plain fiscal years, the same pattern every other granularity-aware selector already used.

### One shared expansion helper for additive fields, a separate one for rates
**Decision:** `expandToGranularity()` divides an FY value across its sub-periods (with a small wobble) for additive/volume fields — ASU/SR counts, call volume, plan dollars. `expandRateToGranularity()` instead keeps percentage/rate fields (UCR target/current) at the same magnitude across every sub-period, only wobbling them slightly.
**Why:** An FY plan of 24,000 ASUs genuinely represents ~6,000 per quarter (additive — the whole year's total is the sum of its quarters), but a UCR target of 88% doesn't represent "22% per quarter" (a rate is the same kind of number regardless of the window you measure it over). Applying the additive divide to a rate field was an actual bug caught during verification — the first pass divided UCR target/current by 4/12/52 the same way as volumes, which would have shown target percentages in the low single digits at Week granularity. Caught by writing a throwaway Node script that exercised every changed selector at all three granularities before calling this done, not by inspection.

### Stacked percentage distribution doesn't reuse either helper
**Decision:** ESG's "Forecast Variance Distribution" (a 4-bucket stacked % chart) gets its own expansion: each sub-period keeps the parent FY's bucket *mix* with a wobble, renormalized so the 4 buckets still sum to ~100%.
**Why:** Neither generic helper fit — dividing the buckets (like a volume) would make them stop summing to 100%; leaving them completely untouched (like a rate) would make every sub-period within a year look identical, which is less useful for a granularity toggle whose entire point is to show variation across the finer time window.

### The global toggle supersedes two decisions made earlier the same day
**Decision:** HES's "UCR Runrate with Target" chart, fixed to always render at Fiscal Year in the previous change ("keep it at fiscal year default"), now responds to the global granularity toggle like every other time-axis chart. The CPASU Trend region-drill's granularity, previously inferred from which of the top filter bar's Quarter/Week filters happened to be selected, is now driven directly by the global toggle instead.
**Why:** The request was explicit that "all the graphs should interact with" the new control — a page-wide granularity setting that silently exempts two charts (one of which had *just* been hardcoded to ignore time filters, for unrelated reasons at the time) would be a confusing inconsistency. Superseding an same-day decision this quickly is unusual, but the new instruction is more specific and directly contradicts the old one for these two charts specifically.

### Region/queue/LOB-axis charts are exempt by nature, not by omission
**Decision:** Plan Impact (region x-axis), Top Queues by Variance (queue x-axis), both Geo Maps (region/sub-region), and the LOB donut breakdowns don't take a `granularity` argument at all.
**Why:** These charts don't have a time axis to begin with — there's no "week" of a region or a queue. Making "all the graphs interact with the filter" literal would mean inventing a meaningless per-week region breakdown; the honest reading is "every chart whose axis is time," which is exactly what changed.

## Landing Page + ESG/HES Capacity Plan Pages (2026-07-03)

### Landing tiles + per-business sub-toggle, not a 4-way top-level toggle
**Decision:** Instead of extending the existing header pill to 4 options (ESG Forecasting/ESG Capacity/HES Forecasting/HES Capacity), the app now opens on a dedicated "ISG SPoG" landing screen with two tiles (ESG/HES); picking one opens that business section, which has its own 2-way Forecasting/Capacity Plan toggle scoped to it.
**Why:** Requested directly and explicitly explained by the user before any screenshots were sent — "front page where there will be two business... clicking on ESG tile it should open the ESG page with toggle between ESG Forecasting and ESG Capacity Plan." A flat 4-way pill would bury the business-level distinction (ESG vs HES) inside a single row of similarly-styled buttons; a landing page makes "pick your business first" a real, separate decision, and the header toggle only ever needs to express one binary choice (which sub-page) once a business is chosen.

### Home button next to the logo, not a tab or breadcrumb
**Decision:** A single icon button (house glyph) sits immediately left of the logo, only rendered when a business section is open; clicking it returns to `view: 'landing'`.
**Why:** Asked directly ("A home button would be fine") after being offered as an option for "how do I get back to the tiles." Placing it at the logo (the conventional "go home" spot in web apps) needed no new UI real estate and reads as an obvious affordance without a label.

### Each business remembers its own last-viewed sub-page independently
**Decision:** `esgSubPage` and `hesSubPage` are two separate `useState` values in `App.jsx`, not one shared `subPage` reset whenever `view` changes.
**Why:** Not explicitly requested, but the alternative (a single shared sub-page that resets to Forecasting every time you go home and pick a business again) would silently discard the user's position if they're bouncing between ESG and HES Capacity Plan mid-session — a small persistence a user would expect from an app framed around "hopping between businesses," and cheap to provide since it's just a second `useState`.

### Two data-only clarifying-question round trips before building
**Decision:** Asked the same clarifying question about ESG Capacity Layer 3's two near-identical visual descriptions ("Actual vs Target Utilization" vs "Queues with Aux culprit") via `AskUserQuestion` twice, at the user's explicit request ("wait" → "ask again" → "ask the same question again you asked me earlier"), rather than assuming the first answer stood or silently re-asking with different wording.
**Why:** The user explicitly asked to see the exact same question repeated, not a rephrased one — re-issuing it verbatim (same options, same framing) respected that literally rather than guessing they wanted something reworded. Confirmed answer both times: Visual 1 is a time-axis trend chart with an Aux-code tooltip; Visual 2 is a per-queue ranking chart, mirroring the existing "Top Queues by Variance" convention already established on ESG Forecasting.

### `ChartKit.jsx` promoted out of `HesChartKit.jsx`, not duplicated a third time
**Decision:** Moved `Visual`/`Tip`/`PlanDropdowns`/`PlanSelect`/`CategoryTick`/`truncate`/`PillButton` from `hes/HesChartKit.jsx` into a new top-level `src/components/ChartKit.jsx`; `HesChartKit.jsx` became a two-line re-export shim (`export { Modal } from '../Modal'; export * from '../ChartKit'`) so no existing HES import had to change. Added `BinaryToggle` (generic two-state pill switch) to the same new file.
**Why:** Both Capacity pages need the exact same chart-panel/tooltip/plan-picker primitives HES Forecasting already had — copying them a third time (ESG Forecasting already has its own near-duplicate) would mean three implementations of the same `Visual` wrapper to keep in sync forever. Promoting once, with a compatibility shim for the existing import path, cost nothing existing and let every subsequent Region/Country toggle (there are six across the two new pages) share one `BinaryToggle` instead of a bespoke switch per file.

### Shared `PlanOverPlanLayer`, parameterized by a `dataFn` prop
**Decision:** Built ESG Capacity's "Plan over Plan Comparison" layer once as `src/components/capacity/PlanOverPlanLayer.jsx`, taking `dataFn(filters, granularity)` as a prop; HES Capacity Plan reuses the identical component, just passing its own `planOverPlanFteByFY` selector.
**Why:** Both mockups specify the literal same layer — one full-width chart, Plan A/B dropdowns, a variance % line — differing only in which numbers back it. Building an ESG-specific copy first and then noticing HES needed the identical thing (caught before HES Capacity was started) made the "parameterize by data source" refactor an easy call rather than a late one.

### HES Capacity reuses `hes/HesFilterPanel.jsx` directly, unmodified
**Decision:** `HesCapacityPage.jsx` imports `HesFilterPanel` from `../hes/HesFilterPanel` as-is, rather than building a new `HesCapacityFilterPanel.jsx`.
**Why:** The mockup's filter list for HES Capacity Plan (LOB, Fiscal Year/Quarter/Month/Week, Business Partner, Global Grouping) is field-for-field identical to HES Forecasting's, and `HesFilterPanel` is already a stateless controlled component with no page-specific hardcoding (filters/onChange/granularity/onGranularityChange props only) — building a byte-identical second copy would be pure duplication for zero behavioral difference. ESG Capacity Plan, by contrast, has a genuinely different filter set (Combined Queue Name/Capacity Code/Plan Name/Business Org/Country, no LOB) from ESG Forecasting, so it got its own `EsgCapacityFilterPanel.jsx`.

### ESG Capacity Utilization Layer: two visuals with near-identical descriptions, disambiguated by axis
**Decision:** "Actual vs Target Utilization" (Visual 1) is a time-axis (Fiscal Year/Quarter/Week) trend with a custom tooltip surfacing which Aux code drove any shortfall; "Queues with Aux Culprit" (Visual 2) is a queue-axis horizontal-bar ranking of which specific queues have the worst Aux-driven utilization gap, worst-first.
**Why:** The mockup's text for both visuals read almost identically, which is why this was the one thing asked about before building (see the clarifying-question entry above). Resolving it by axis — one chart answers "how are we trending over time," the other answers "which queues are the problem" — reuses the exact "diverging/ranking queue chart" pattern already established for Top Queues by Variance on ESG Forecasting, rather than inventing a third chart shape for a page that's supposed to feel like the same product.

### Aux-culprit fields attached after granularity expansion, not passed through it
**Decision:** `utilizationByFY()` computes `auxCulprit`/`auxImpactPct` per output row by array index, after calling `expandRateToGranularity()` on the numeric `actual`/`target` fields, rather than trying to pass the categorical Aux-code field through the expansion helper itself.
**Why:** `expandRateToGranularity`/`expandToGranularity` are built for numeric fields (percentages or volumes) — a categorical string field like an Aux-code name has no meaningful "expansion" operation. Attaching it post-hoc, keyed by the resulting array's index (which is correct regardless of whether the array has 3/12/36/156 rows for Year/Quarter/Month/Week), avoided modifying the shared expansion helpers to special-case a non-numeric field that only this one chart needs.

### Two sort-direction bugs caught by Node smoke tests, not code review
**Decision:** `utilizationByQueue()` was fixed from sorting ascending by `|utilGap|` (which surfaced the *best*-adhering queues) to descending (worst first); `leavesByQueue()` was fixed from sorting ascending by raw delta only (which missed large positive-delta outliers, biasing toward queues with fewer-than-planned leaves) to selecting the top-N by `|delta|` descending first, then re-sorting that shortlist ascending for display.
**Why:** Both bugs were invisible from reading the code — the sort call looked reasonable in isolation. Writing a Node smoke-test script that actually printed the resulting rows for a representative filter set (before any UI was built on top of the data module) surfaced both immediately: the "worst queues" list was showing near-perfect adherence, and the "outage" list was all negative deltas. This is the same "verify with real output, not just a clean build" discipline used for every granularity-toggle change earlier in this project.

### `HES_GEO_SLO_BY_REGION` values tuned to hit the mockup's literal "2 regions at risk" text
**Decision:** The 4 illustrative region SLO values were chosen (97/88/96/79) so that exactly 2 sit below the FY27 SLO target (95), rather than picking arbitrary-looking numbers that happened to produce 1 or 3.
**Why:** The mockup's card sub-message is a specific, literal number ("2 regions at risk") — since this is illustrative mock data anyway (no real per-region SLO dataset exists), there was no reason not to tune it to match the one concrete detail the mockup specified, rather than let an arbitrary formula produce a number that visibly contradicts the mockup's own text.

### HES Capacity's Sankey: illustrative CQN tiers as sources, real LOB names as targets
**Decision:** `workloadSankey()` uses 3 fixed illustrative source-node labels (`CQN-Standard`/`CQN-Critical`/`CQN-Enterprise`) flowing into 4 real LOB names (`Networking`/`Storage`/`Server`/`PowerScale`, all genuine entries from `LOB_LIST`).
**Why:** HES Capacity Plan's filter set has no per-queue (CQN) dimension of its own — LOB is the only real categorical axis this page's filters expose. Rather than fabricate fake per-queue names to match the mockup's "CQN to LOB" framing literally, the source tiers are clearly-illustrative priority-band labels while the target nodes use real business names, following the same "real names + illustrative structure" principle as every other mock dataset in this app.

### HES Capacity Geo Map renumbered from the mockup's "Layer 5" to badge 04
**Decision:** The mockup's screenshots show Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → Layer 5 for this page's geo map, with no Layer 4 shown anywhere. The shipped UI labels it **04**.
**Why:** A visible gap in sequential badge numbering (01, 02, 03, 05) would read as a bug or a missing section to anyone looking at the page, not as a faithful reproduction of the source deck's own typo/gap. Every other layer-badged section in this app (both Forecasting pages, ESG Capacity) uses strictly sequential 01-04 numbering; matching that convention here is more consistent than preserving an apparent numbering mistake from the mockup.

## ESG Capacity Plan: Revision Pass — Filters, Cards, Drills, Aux Detail (2026-07-03)

### Filters: reuse ESG Forecasting's own lists instead of page-specific ones
**Decision:** Plan Name now uses `mockData.js`'s `PLAN_NAMES` (was a page-specific `CAPACITY_PLAN_NAMES`), Sub-region uses the same `SUB_REGIONS` list as ESG Forecasting; Business Org and Country were removed entirely rather than kept as unused/decorative fields.
**Why:** Requested directly ("Use same plan name for ESG Capacity used for ESG Forecasting," "remove this filter completely" for Business Org, "remove this completely and add sub-region instead"). Neither `businessOrg` nor `country` was ever consumed by a data selector on this page beyond narrowing the queue fact table — removing them outright (rather than leaving inert filter chips) is honest about what actually drives the page's numbers, and reusing Forecasting's own lists keeps a queue's Plan Name/Sub-region options identical whichever ESG page you're on.

### Sub-region tag reused from ACTIVE_QUEUES, not re-derived
**Decision:** `CAPACITY_QUEUES`'s `subRegion` field reads `ACTIVE_QUEUES[i]?.subRegion` (same index, same source array) instead of building an independent round-robin assignment.
**Why:** Both fact tables are built from the identical `ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` array in the same order — reusing the existing tag guarantees a queue shows the same sub-region on ESG Forecasting and ESG Capacity, whereas two independently-computed round-robins (even both deterministic) would drift apart the moment their modulo arithmetic differed even slightly. One source of truth for a fact that's supposed to be the same fact everywhere.

### Cards: YTD/YoY sub-message, reusing HES Forecasting's own pattern verbatim
**Decision:** All 5 ESG Capacity cards now show `YTD <period>: <value> · ▲/▼ X% vs <prevPeriod>` via a `ytdSub` helper copied structurally from `HesMetricCards.jsx`, replacing each card's static "Target ..."/"Plan ..." sub-line. The headline value drills with the page-wide granularity toggle (`capacityCardData(filters, granularity)`); the YoY comparison itself stays FY-over-FY regardless of granularity.
**Why:** Requested directly for all 5 cards, plus "cards should change according to the quarter, month and week slicer." Reusing the exact pattern already proven on HES Forecasting (rather than inventing a new sub-line format) keeps every card across the app speaking the same "YTD vs prior year" language. FY-over-FY YoY regardless of granularity mirrors `hesCardData`'s own reasoning: the sub-year numbers are synthesized from the FY total via a deterministic wobble, so a "quarter vs same quarter last year" comparison would be comparing two synthetic numbers with no real independent basis — the FY comparison is the only one with an actual signal behind it.

### Total FTE / Attrition: inverted color logic now compares YoY, not vs plan/target
**Decision:** Both cards' green/red status now reflects the YoY direction (`yoyPct`) rather than actual-vs-plan/target — an increase is red (bad) for both, a decrease is green (good).
**Why:** Requested directly ("if total FTE is increased over past year then it is not a good sign for business... show it as red and vice versa," repeated for Attrition). This is a different axis than the card's own headline number staying an absolute value (still "actual" for FTE, "actual %" for Attrition) — only the color judgment moved from a static-target comparison to a YoY one, consistent with every other card on this page now being framed around YTD/YoY.

### Attrition and Plan over Plan Variation: region/sub-region drill, not a flat lens toggle
**Decision:** Both visuals moved from a cosmetic "Region/Country lens" (a small multiplier that barely changed the numbers) to a real click-to-drill mechanic: a default view with one bar per region or sub-region key (sized by `shareByKey` — each key's share of currently in-scope queues), and clicking a bar drills into that key's own FY/granularity trend via `attritionTrendByDimension`/`planOverPlanTrendByDimension`.
**Why:** Requested directly and specifically ("the region and sub-region toggle should work like keep the graph at region level and when user clicks on particular region the Fiscal year graph should open and should be able to change according to the filters above"). This is the exact same "region-level default, click to drill into time trend" mechanic already proven on HES Forecasting's CPASU Trend (`AsuSrTrendLayer.jsx` Visual1) — reusing a pattern the codebase already has, rather than inventing a new interaction, for a request that describes that pattern almost verbatim.

### `shareByKey` extracted as a shared helper, not duplicated per visual
**Decision:** A single `shareByKey(rows, key)` function computes a `{key: share}` distribution for either `'region'` or `'subRegion'`, used by both `attritionByDimension` and `planOverPlanByDimension` (and their trend-drill counterparts).
**Why:** Both visuals needed the identical "how should a Region/Sub-region default view distribute a single aggregate baseline across N keys" logic — deriving shares from actual queue counts (rather than hand-maintaining a hardcoded share table with an entry per region AND per sub-region, 4 + 24 = 28 magic numbers) scales automatically if `SUB_REGIONS` or `REGIONS` ever change, and guarantees the shares are internally consistent with whatever queues the current filters actually left in scope.

### Attrition tooltip: raw attritted-employee count added alongside the percentage
**Decision:** A new `attritionCount` field (`Math.round(headcount * attrition / 100)`) is computed per row and shown in a custom tooltip below the existing Headcount/Attrition-% lines, rather than added as a third plotted series.
**Why:** "Attrition % along with original number should be shown" — read as "the underlying count, not just the ratio," since a bare percentage without its denominator's scale is genuinely harder to reason about. Surfacing it in the tooltip (rather than a third bar/line) keeps the chart itself uncluttered while still making the number available on hover, consistent with how Utilization's Aux breakdown and Plan-over-Plan's queue-variance tooltip also carry supporting numbers that don't need their own axis.

### "Headcount Impact on SL" defaulter list: AND, not OR
**Decision:** `slDefaulterQueues` requires **both** `actualHC > planHC` **and** `slActual < 90` — a queue that's merely over headcount plan (with healthy SL) or merely below 90% SL (while adequately staffed) no longer appears.
**Why:** Requested directly and explicitly: "if the actuals are more than plan and still SL% dropped below 90 then those queues should be shown." The old logic (over-plan headcount alone) answered a different, less actionable question — "who's overstaffed" — the new rule specifically surfaces "who's overstaffed AND still failing," which is the genuinely alarming case worth a manager's attention (extra heads didn't fix the problem).

### Plan over Plan Variation: split into its own component instead of extending the shared layer
**Decision:** Built a new ESG-only `PlanOverPlanVariationLayer.jsx` rather than adding Region/Sub-region toggle + queue-variance-ranking branches to the shared `capacity/PlanOverPlanLayer.jsx` that HES Capacity also uses.
**Why:** None of these new capabilities were requested for HES Capacity's Plan-over-Plan layer, and HES doesn't have an equivalent per-queue variance concept (it has LOBs, not queues) to rank in the first place. Branching the shared component on a page-specific feature set (`if (page === 'esg') {...}`) would make it neither simple nor truly shared — splitting cleanly here, while leaving HES's usage of the original shared component completely untouched, keeps both call sites simple. The now-unused `planOverPlanHCByFY` selector and its `CAPACITY_PLAN_VS_PLAN_BY_FY`-consuming function were removed from `esgCapacityData.js` as dead code once nothing called them anymore.

### "Queues with Highest Variation" reuses the polished diverging-bar convention, not a plain list
**Decision:** The new queue-variance ranking is a diverging horizontal bar chart with a zero `ReferenceLine`, rounded axis ticks, and `+X%`/`-X%` value labels printed at each bar's end via two sign-split `LabelList`s — the exact same construction as Forecasting's "Top Queues by Variance" charts (`Layer1PlanOverPlan.jsx` Visual3), not the simple text-list format used by HeadcountLayer's SL-defaulter list or Utilization's leaves list.
**Why:** Explicitly called out as "the most important graph in ESG Capacity planning... make it worth" — the diverging-bar-with-labels treatment is this codebase's most visually resolved pattern for "which of these things is furthest off," reserved until now for the Forecasting page's own headline variance charts. Giving this visual the same treatment (rather than a plain sorted list, which several other defaulter/outage lists on this page already use) signals it's meant to carry the same weight.

### Utilization: 3-Aux breakdown instead of a single culprit, everywhere a culprit was shown
**Decision:** `utilizationByFY` now returns a sorted `auxBreakdown` array (top 3 by impact) instead of a single `auxCulprit`/`auxImpactPct` pair (kept as `auxBreakdown[0]` for anything still expecting the old shape); `utilizationByQueue` similarly returns 3 distinct `auxes` per queue. Visual1 also gained an Adherence % trend line.
**Why:** Requested directly for both visuals ("it can be driven by many auxes show at least 3," "Add 2-3 auxes in the list as well") plus "Show a line for adherence as well." A single culprit code was always a simplification — real utilization shortfalls are rarely attributable to exactly one Aux code — so surfacing the top 3 (still deterministic mock data, same "real-code-names + illustrative structure" convention) is a more honest shape for what the tooltip claims to explain.

### Renaming "Outage — Actual vs Target Leaves" to "Leave Impact — Actual vs Target"
**Decision:** The user asked for a better name but didn't supply one ("I am not getting any name rn"); picked "Leave Impact — Actual vs Target."
**Why:** The visual shows which queues are burning more leave-days than planned and by how much — "impact" better captures "this is a contributing factor to a problem" than "outage" (which implies the leaves themselves are the failure, when really they're a driver of understaffing/SL risk elsewhere on the page). Matches the "Actual vs Target" phrasing pattern already used by Visual1's title on the same layer, for naming consistency within the layer.

### Geo Map: Sub-region replaces Country, mirroring ESG Forecasting's own fallback mechanic exactly
**Decision:** The Region/Country `BinaryToggle` became Region/Sub-region, using `subRegionForCountry`/`SUB_REGIONS` and the identical "unmapped countries fall back to their parent region's shade at 35% opacity, suppressed once Region/Sub-region filters already narrow the view" logic as `Layer3GeoMap.jsx`.
**Why:** Directly requested, and once Country was removed as a filter dimension entirely (see above), keeping a Country-based map view would have been the one place on the page still referencing a retired concept. Sub-region is also the correct replacement dimension precisely because it's now a real filter on this page's own filter bar (unlike the old curated 14-country list, which had no matching filter) — map view and filter dimension now agree, matching how the region/sub-region relationship already works on ESG Forecasting's own Geo Map.

## ESG Capacity Plan: Cases per FTE Card + RCA/CLCA Sidebar (2026-07-03)

### Total FTE → Cases per FTE, not an additional 6th card
**Decision:** The "Total FTE" card was replaced outright by "Cases per FTE" rather than adding Cases per FTE as a new sixth card.
**Why:** Requested directly ("Change the Total FTE card to Cases per FTE"), read as a swap, not an addition — the 5-card row layout stays intact and Total FTE's underlying headcount data is still fully visible elsewhere on the page (HeadcountLayer's "Actual vs Plan Variation" visual), so nothing was actually lost by dropping its own dedicated card.

### Cases per FTE: YTD-only, the one card without a YoY comparison
**Decision:** `ytdSub` is bypassed for this one card — its sub-line is a plain `YTD ${period}: ${actual}` string with no `▲/▼ X% vs prevPeriod` suffix and no trend pip, unlike all 4 other cards on this page.
**Why:** Requested directly ("show the card as YTD only"). Rather than compute a `yoyPct` the UI would just discard, `capacityCardData`'s `casesPerFte` field only carries `{actual, plan, period}` — no `prevPeriod`/`yoyPct` at all, so the data shape itself documents that no comparison is expected here, instead of leaving unused fields that a future reader might assume are wired up somewhere.

### Cases per FTE popup: Actual vs Plan lines, not a single trend
**Decision:** The drill-down chart plots two lines (Actual, Plan — dashed) instead of one, matching the request literally ("cases per FTE actual and Plan").
**Why:** Every other single-metric popup on this page's cards (SL%, Attrition) plots one line because there's genuinely one number to show; Cases per FTE explicitly has two (an actual and a plan), so the chart follows the same "one line per real distinct series" rule rather than picking one arbitrarily.

### RCA/CLCA sidebar: same mechanism, page-specific content
**Decision:** New `EsgCapacityRcaClcaPanel.jsx`, wired into `EsgCapacityPage.jsx` with the identical sticky-sidebar-next-to-Analysis-Layers layout as `RcaClcaPanel`/`HesRcaClcaPanel`, with its own illustrative findings written in this page's vocabulary (staffing, utilization, SL%, attrition, Cases per FTE) instead of reusing either Forecasting page's copy.
**Why:** Requested directly ("add a RCA and RLCA section as we did for ESG Forecasting") — "as we did" was read as *same mechanism and layout*, not *same words*, consistent with the identical precedent already established when HES Forecasting got its own RCA/CLCA sidebar (see "HES-specific RCA/CLCA sidebar content" above). ESG Capacity Plan didn't have this sidebar originally because the mockups it was built from never showed one; adding it now is a direct, explicit request rather than a gap being filled in retroactively.
