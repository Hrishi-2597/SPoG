# Project Handoff — ISG SPoG ESG Forecasting Dashboard

## Filter Bar Gap Fix + Light/Dark Theme Toggle (2026-07-02)

- **Fixed a layout bug on HES Forecasting's filter bar**: the Time cluster (Fiscal Year/Quarter/Month/Week) left a visible empty gap before the People cluster (Business Partner/Global Grouping). Root cause: `HesFilterPanel.jsx`'s `Cluster` grid div was missing `flex-1 min-w-0` — the Forecasting page's `FilterPanel.jsx` already had this on its own `Cluster`, so its clusters correctly stretch to fill the row; HES's didn't, so its Time cluster's outer flex-grow allocation went unused as blank space instead of being consumed by the grid inside it. One-line fix.
- **Added a light/dark theme toggle for both pages.** New sun/moon pill switch in the header (next to the ESG/HES page toggle), persisted to `localStorage`, applied via a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.
  - New `src/index.css` CSS custom-property system: `:root` (dark, default) and `[data-theme='light']` define `--bg-page/panel/raised/inset`, `--border-subtle/default/strong`, `--text-primary/secondary/dim/faint/muted`, `--accent` (+`--accent-contrast` for text-on-accent), `--tooltip-bg`, `--chart-grid`, `--select-bg`, `--scrollbar-*`, `--shadow-card*`.
  - Every shared CSS class (`.card-panel`, `.chart-panel`, `.layer-header`, `.select-dark`, `.ms-*`, `.filter-chip`, `.drill-toggle`/`.drill-btn`, `.chart-tooltip`, scrollbars) now reads these variables instead of hardcoded hex, so both pages re-skin from one place.
  - Every component's inline "chrome" colors (backgrounds, borders, primary/secondary/muted text) were rerouted to `var(--...)` across `App.jsx`, `SectionDivider.jsx`, `FilterPanel.jsx`/`HesFilterPanel.jsx`, `MultiSelectField.jsx`, `MetricCards.jsx`/`HesMetricCards.jsx`, `Modal.jsx`, `RcaClcaPanel.jsx`/`HesRcaClcaPanel.jsx`, `HesChartKit.jsx`, and all 7 layer/geo-map files (`Layer1PlanOverPlan`, `Layer2ActualVsPlan`, `Layer3GeoMap`, `AsuLayer`, `SrLayer`, `AsuSrTrendLayer`, `HesGeoMap`).
  - **Deliberately left static (same color in both themes):** chart series colors (accent/orange/violet/green/red role assignments), region color palettes, the geo accuracy color scale, status badges, and the geo map's own canvas (background/country fills/borders) — see `design_choice.md` for the reasoning per category.

## ESG Forecasting: Corrected Queue Roster (2026-07-02)

- **`ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` and `INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` (`mockData.js`) were replaced wholesale** with a corrected, business-supplied roster: **47 active** (down from 199) and **146 inactive** (down from 406, including `'CCC MidRange Mandarin'` — moved here from the prior active list). Total Queues: 193 (was 605).
- No code changes were needed beyond the two array literals — every selector (`filterQueues`, `callVolumeByFY`, `dbOspVolumeByFY`, `cardData`, the CQN-variance charts, etc.) reads `ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES.length`/`ACTIVE_QUEUES.length` dynamically rather than a hardcoded count, so the whole filtering/scaling pipeline picked up the new roster automatically.
- Verified no duplicate names within either list and no overlap between the two lists (scripted check, not just eyeballing).
- Region tagging (`inferRegion()`) still resolves sensibly against the new names — no `NAMER` entries in the new active list, which is fine (the Total Queues donut and Geo Map already handle a region having zero/no data).

## Forecasting Page: Card Drill-Downs Are Now Modals Too (2026-07-02)

- **`MetricCards.jsx`'s 5 card drill-downs (Total Queues, Call Volume, DB/OSP Split, Forecast Accuracy, CQN Variance) now open in a popup modal**, matching the behavior already shipped for HES Forecasting's cards. Closing the modal only clears local `active` state — `filters` (owned by `ForecastingPage`) is untouched, so the dashboard is exactly as filtered when it closes.
- **`Modal` extracted to a shared `src/components/Modal.jsx`**, used by both pages. `src/components/hes/HesChartKit.jsx` now re-exports it (`export { Modal } from '../Modal'`) instead of defining its own copy — no HES import needed to change.
- The nested **CQN Variance year-click modal (`YearQueueModal`)** is unchanged in implementation — it's now a modal nested inside a modal instead of nested inside an inline panel, which needed no code changes to keep working.

## HES Forecasting: Total Queues Card + RCA/CLCA Sidebar (2026-07-02)

- **Total Queues card added at the front of the Key Metrics row**, mirroring the Forecasting page's card exactly (icon, "Active / Inactive" sublabel, `71 / 221` value format, "150 inactive queues" sub-line). **UCR Impacted SR (the last card) was removed** to make room — the row is back to 5 cards: Total Queues, Active Service Units, Service Requests, CPASU, Current UCR.
- **Data source:** `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']`'s real 71 active / ~150 inactive queue names — previously treated as one LOB's queue sample, now used as the page-level "HES queue roster" for this card, since it's the only real per-queue name data this page has. New exports in `hesData.js`: `HES_ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES`, `HES_INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES`, `HES_ACTIVE_QUEUES` (each active name tagged with a region via `inferRegion()`, newly exported from `mockData.js`). `hesCardData()` gained a `totalQueues` field; it doesn't respond to any filter (no per-queue lob/businessPartner/globalGrouping tags exist to narrow by).
- **Drill-down is a region donut + table**, same mechanic as the Forecasting page's Total Queues card: click a slice (or legend entry) to narrow the table below to that region, click again or "Clear" to reset. Table shows Queue + Region (no Accuracy column — that concept doesn't exist for HES queues, so it wasn't included just to visually match).
- **`ucrImpactedSrByFY()` removed** as dead code along with the card that used it.
- **New RCA & CLCA sidebar** (`HesRcaClcaPanel.jsx`) — sticky right-hand column alongside Layers 1-4 (AsuLayer/SrLayer/AsuSrTrendLayer/HesGeoMap), same layout mechanism as the Forecasting page's `RcaClcaPanel` (starts at the "Analysis Layers" divider, KPI cards stay full-width). Content is illustrative and written specifically for this page's own metrics (ASU/SR/CPASU/UCR/LOB language) rather than reusing the Forecasting page's queue/call-volume-themed copy, per the standing decision documented in `design_choice.md` not to copy that content verbatim.

## HES Forecasting: Card Modals, Renames & Layer 3 Redesign (2026-07-02)

- **Card drill-downs are now popup modals**, not inline panels. `HesMetricCards.jsx`'s `DrillDownModal` wraps every card's chart in the new shared `Modal` (`HesChartKit.jsx`) — centered overlay, closes on backdrop click or ✕. Closing it only clears local `active` state; `filters` is untouched, so the dashboard is exactly as the user left it.
- **Card renames + YTD messaging:** "ASU Actuals" → **Active Service Units**, "SR Actuals" → **Service Requests**. All three of ASU/SR/CPASU swapped their static "Plan X · Y% adherence" sub-line for a YTD year-over-year message (e.g. `YTD FY27: 24.2K · ▲ 8.3% vs FY26`), computed by a new `yoyPct` field per metric in `hesCardData()` — `null` when there's no prior year in scope (e.g. filtered to a single FY), shown as "no prior year in scope" instead of a misleading 0%. CPASU inverts the color logic (`lowerIsBetter`) since falling CPASU is the good direction.
- **SR Actuals popup**: DB/OSP chart changed from a stacked bar to grouped columns.
- **CPASU popup**: changed from a Composed chart (SR/ASU bars + CPASU line) to a line-only chart of CPASU across fiscal years.
- **ASU Layer → ASU Trend, SR Layer → SR Trend.** Visual 1 renamed "Actuals vs Plan Comparison" (Plan dropdown relabeled "Plan Name"), Visual 2 renamed "Plan vs Plan Comparison", Visual 3 renamed "Plan Impact". Plan Impact's region set changed from `['NAMER','EMEA','APJ']` to `IMPACT_REGIONS = ['AMER','APJ','EMEA','Global']` — reshapes `ASU_REGION_PLANS`/`SR_REGION_PLANS`/`asuLobImpact`/`srLobImpact` too, since all four are built off `IMPACT_REGIONS`.
- **"ASU Impact on SR Trend" → ASU/UCR Impact on SR Analysis.**
  - Visual 1 ("ASU Impact on SR Trend with CPASU" → **CPASU Trend**) redesigned: the old Region/Country toggle is gone. Shows all 4 `IMPACT_REGIONS` by default (grouped ASU/SR bars + CPASU line, one group per region); clicking a region drills into that region's own trend at whichever time granularity is most specific in the top filter bar (Week > Quarter > Year), via new `regionTrendGranularity()`/`cpasuTrendByRegion()` selectors.
  - Visual 2 ("UCR Impact on SR") kept its name; series renamed **SR's** (was "SR (Human)") and **UCR Handled SR's** (was "SR (Bots)"); gained a Plan Name selector in the top-right corner via `Visual`'s new `cornerControls` slot — cosmetic/unwired for now, same as AsuLayer/SrLayer Visual 1's Plan dropdown.
  - Visual 3 ("UCR Runrate with Target") now always renders all 3 fiscal years (ignores Quarter/Week narrowing) and dropped its always-visible "queues not adhering" list. Clicking a year's bar opens a modal (new `topNonAdherentLobsByYear()` selector) listing that year's top 5 non-adherent **LOBs** (not queues). `ucrNonAdherentQueues()` and its fallback constant were removed as dead code.

**Verification:** `npm run build` succeeds cleanly. This session's environment doesn't have browser-automation tooling available, so the popups/drill-throughs were verified by code review and a grep sweep for stale references, not by clicking through a rendered browser — worth a manual pass before treating this as fully verified.

## New page: HES Forecasting (2026-07-02, renamed same day)

The dashboard now has **two pages**, switched via a pill toggle in the header (same `.drill-toggle`/`.drill-btn` pattern used elsewhere): **ESG Forecasting** (everything below, unchanged) and **HES Forecasting** (new — originally built and briefly named "ESG Capacity Planning", renamed at the user's request before anything shipped further). `App.jsx` is now a thin shell — header + toggle + footer — that renders `ForecastingPage.jsx` (the old `App.jsx` body, extracted verbatim) or `HesForecastingPage.jsx` depending on which pill is active.

HES Forecasting is built from **slides 5–6 of `SPOG_views.pptx`** (the ASU/SR/UCR mockups the user confirmed via screenshot), not the slides originally guessed. Structure:

| Section | File | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Filter bar (7 filters: LOB, Fiscal Year/Quarter/Month/Week, Business Partner, Global Grouping) | `HesFilterPanel.jsx` | Same clustered/searchable-multi-select pattern as ESG Forecasting |
| 5 KPI cards (ASU Actuals, SR Actuals, CPASU, Current UCR, UCR Impacted SR) | `HesMetricCards.jsx` | Same card + inline drill-down-chart pattern as ESG Forecasting |
| Layer 01 — ASU Layer | `AsuLayer.jsx` | Actual vs Plan+Adherence, Plan-on-Plan, Plan Impact Analysis (click a region bar → LOB contribution list) |
| Layer 02 — SR Layer | `SrLayer.jsx` | Same 3 visuals as ASU Layer, SR metric |
| Layer 03 — ASU Impact on SR Trend | `AsuSrTrendLayer.jsx` | ASU/SR + CPASU trend (Region/Country toggle), UCR Impact on SR (human vs bots stacked), UCR Runrate with Target + non-adherent queue list |
| Layer 04 — Geo Map | `HesGeoMap.jsx` | Choropleth by LOB adherence per region (no Region/Sub-region toggle — deck only specifies region-level) |

All of the above, plus the shared chart primitives (`HesChartKit.jsx`) and the data module (`hesData.js`), live under `src/components/hes/` and `src/data/hesData.js` — renamed from `capacity/`/`capacityData.js` in the same pass as the page label.

No RCA/CLCA sidebar on this page — that panel's content is Forecasting-specific and wasn't part of the ASU/SR/UCR slides; revisit if the user wants an equivalent for HES Forecasting.

**Real data used:**
- **33 real LOB names** (Avamar, BSAFE, DataDomain, High End Storage, PowerScale, Symmetrix, VCF, XtremIO, etc. — user-supplied verbatim) back the LOB filter and every `LOB_LIST`-keyed structure in `hesData.js`.
- **Real active/inactive queue lists for the "High End Storage" LOB** (71 active, ~150 inactive, user-supplied verbatim, stored in `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']`) — when the LOB filter is scoped to "High End Storage", the "UCR Runrate with Target" non-adherent-queue list switches from a generic fallback to these real queue names. Verified live: filtering to High End Storage shows real names like "APJ HES MIDRANGE Japanese" and "Global HES Midrange FL" in that list.
- `GLOBAL_GROUPING_LIST = ['Consumer','Commercial','Enterprise']` is an inference (not yet explicitly confirmed by the user) based on an earlier PPT note about a future Shipment Trend page — flagged as illustrative in code.
- Everything else (ASU/SR volumes, UCR targets, region-plan-impact deltas, adherence-by-region) is illustrative mock data generated deterministically, same "real names + illustrative structure" convention as the ESG Forecasting page.

**Bug fixed during verification:** `buildLobImpact()`'s delta formula (`(i*7 + ri*13) % 21`) only produced 3 distinct values per region, so multiple LOBs in the "Plan Impact Analysis" drill-down showed an identical delta (e.g. six LOBs all reading `-2400` for NAMER). Fixed by using `(i*17 + ri*41) % 131` — 17 is coprime with the prime modulus 131, so the mapping is injective across all 33 LOBs for a fixed region, guaranteeing distinct deltas.

## Latest polish pass (2026-07-02)

- Diverging "Top Queue Variance" charts (both layers) now print the exact `+X%`/`-X%` value at the end of each bar via two sign-split `LabelList`s using Recharts' built-in `position="left"`/`"right"` — a hand-computed label position drifted into the bar interior and was unreadable. Axis ticks rounded to clean 5% steps; queue-name truncation now breaks on the last word boundary instead of mid-word.
- Renamed: Layer 1 Visual 1 "Fiscal Year Plan Variance" → **PoP Variation**; Layer 2 Visual 1 "Fiscal Year Adherence" → **Actual vs Plan Variation**.
- RCA & CLCA sidebar now starts at the "Analysis Layers" divider, not "Key Metrics" — the 5 KPI cards span the full page width on their own.
- Forecast Variance Distribution's tooltip now shows queue **counts** per bucket (e.g. "< 10%: 76 queues") instead of repeating the % already printed on the bar — computed from the same DB/OSP-agnostic queue count the Total Queues card uses, so it stays consistent with the rest of the dashboard as filters change.
- Call Volume drill-down (Offered vs Handled) gained a **Handled %** line on a second right-hand axis (0–100%, clean 25% ticks), matching the dual-axis + trend-line pattern already used everywhere else (Adherence %, Accuracy %, Variance %). Colored violet, consistent with the app's "neutral % trend line" convention.
- Both diverging "Top Queue Variance" charts renamed to **Top Queues by Variance** (same name in both layers — disambiguated by which layer they're in) and lost their "Green = ahead · Red = behind" subtitle, since the exact `+X%`/`-X%` value label on every bar already makes the color meaning obvious.

## Real Data Wired In (as of 2026-07-01)

Queue names, capacity codes, plan names, business partners, sub-regions, and L5 managers are all real values supplied by the business:

| Constant | Count | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` | 47 (updated 2026-07-02, was 199) | Queue Name filter, feeds the `ACTIVE_QUEUES` fact table |
| `INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` | 146 (updated 2026-07-02, was 406) | Total Queues card total (193 = 47 + 146); not yet drillable |
| `CAPACITY_CODES` | ~610 | Capacity Code filter, tagged onto each active queue |
| `PLAN_NAMES` | 4 (`AOP_FY26Q4_AA`, `FY27 Q1 APR Plan`, `FY27 Q2 JUN Plan`, `FY27Q1_AA`) | Plan Name filter, Layer 1 Plan A/B dropdowns, Layer 2 plan selector |
| `FISCAL_QUARTERS` | 12 (`FY25Q1` ... `FY27Q4`) | Fiscal Quarter filter |
| `FISCAL_WEEK_LIST` | 156 (`FY25W01` ... `FY27W52`) | Fiscal Week filter |
| `BUSINESS_PARTNERS` | 7 real names | Business Partner filter, tagged onto each active queue |
| `REGIONS` | `['APJ','EMEA','Global','LATAM','NAMER']` | Region filter, Layer 1 `PLAN_VS_PLAN_BY_REGION`, Geo Map |
| `SUB_REGIONS` | 24 real values | Sub-region filter, tagged onto each active queue |
| `L5_MANAGERS` | 15 real names | L5 Manager filter, tagged onto each active queue |

Region for each active queue is inferred from its name prefix (`inferRegion()` in `mockData.js`) — APJ/EMEA/LATAM/NAMER/Global — since no explicit region field was supplied with the queue list.

---

## Filters Are Live (as of 2026-07-01)

The filter bar was rebuilt and every filter now actually drives the charts and cards — this used to be UI-only. See `tech_spec.md` → "Data Model" for the full mechanism. Highlights:

- **`ACTIVE_QUEUES` is now a fact table.** Each of the 199 queues carries region, sub-region, capacity code, business partner, L5 manager, channel, and DB/OSP tags (assigned deterministically, round-robin, since the source lists don't specify a real per-queue mapping — mock data enriched with realistic *structure*, not a real business relationship). `filterQueues(filters)` narrows this table by 8 of the 12 filters; every KPI card, the queue drill-down table, and both "CQN Highest Variance" charts are recomputed from whatever rows remain.
- **DB/OSP scopes volume only, not queue portfolio.** Total Queues / Forecast Accuracy / CQN Variance / the CQN-variance charts ignore the DB/OSP toggle (a queue's accuracy doesn't change depending on which slice of its volume you're viewing); Call Volume / DB-OSP Split respect it fully. This split exists so the default `dbOsp: 'DB'` filter doesn't make the headline "Total Queues" count look wrong on first load.
- **Fiscal Year/Quarter/Week collapsed into one time scope.** Whichever is most specific (Week > Quarter > Year) determines the single FY shown; charts are always at FY granularity now (see below).
- **Region filter narrows the Region chart and the Geo Map** (both view modes) to the matching region. Selecting "Global" on the Geo Map shows an explanatory empty state (no lat/lng data at that granularity), not a blank confusing screen.
- **Plan Name filter pre-selects the primary plan (Plan A)** in both Layer 1 and Layer 2 — the per-visual Plan A/B dropdowns still work independently after that, per the original design decision.
- **Capacity Code, Channel, Business Partner, Sub-region, L5 Manager** all narrow the same fact table, so they affect cards, the drill-down table, and the CQN-variance charts together.

### FY/Quarter/Week toggles removed from charts

Layer 1 Visual 1 and Layer 2 Visual 1 used to have their own `FY / Quarter / Week` segmented toggle, duplicating the top filter bar. That control is gone — those charts are now always at Fiscal Year granularity, and the top-bar Fiscal Year/Quarter/Week filters determine which year(s) they show. `PLAN_VS_PLAN_BY_QTR/WEEK` and `ACTUAL_VS_PLAN_BY_QTR/WEEK` were removed from `mockData.js` since nothing renders them anymore. Layer 1 Visual 2 also lost its Region/Country toggle switch — it never actually changed the chart's data source (a pre-existing latent bug), and no per-country plan-over-plan dataset exists to back a real "Country" view.

### Filter bar redesign

The filter bar was restructured away from a flat 12-dropdown grid (which read like a generic BI slicer panel) into 4 icon-labeled clusters — Scope, Time, People, Geography — with a DB/OSP segmented pill instead of a third binary dropdown, and an "applied filters" chip strip that appears under the bar once anything is scoped (each chip removable, plus "Clear all"). Queue Name and Capacity Code render in a monospace face since they're system codes, not names. See `design_choice.md` for the full rationale.

### Filters are searchable multi-selects

All 11 dropdown filters (everything except DB/OSP, which stays the 3-way segmented pill) are now `MultiSelectField` — a button that opens a popover with a search box, "Select all"/"Clear", and a checkbox list; pick any number of values. This mattered most for Queue Name (originally 199 options, now 47 — see the 2026-07-02 roster update above) and Capacity Code (~610), which were unusable to scroll through as a plain `<select>`.

**Every filter's value changed from a string to an array.** `[]` means "no selection = All" (this replaced the old `'All'` sentinel string everywhere except `dbOsp`). `filterQueues()` and every region/FY selector in `mockData.js` now check `array.includes(value)` instead of `value === selected`. If you're adding a new filter or a new selector function, follow that pattern — see `tech_spec.md` → "Data Model".

## KPI Card Drill-Downs Rebuilt (as of 2026-07-01)

Each card's pop-up went from a raw table to an actual chart matching what the card measures:

| Card | Drill-down now shows |
|---|---|
| Total Queues | Region breakdown donut chart on top (click a slice, or its legend entry, to filter the table below to just that region's queues; click again, or "Clear", to reset) |
| Call Volume | Bar chart: Offered vs Handled, by Fiscal Year (raw numbers, no %) |
| DB / OSP Split | Bar chart: DB Offered vs OSP Offered, by Fiscal Year — deliberately ignores the ambient DB/OSP filter (showing the split IS the point; collapsing to one bar when the filter is "DB" would defeat it) |
| Forecast Accuracy | Bar+line chart: Actual vs Forecast volume per region (APJ/EMEA/Global/LATAM/NAMER), with a Forecast Accuracy % line on a second axis |
| CQN Variance | Bar chart: % of queues within ±10% variance, year on year (FY25/26/27) — **click a year's bar** to open a pop-up listing 4–5 example queues in that band for the current filter scope |

**CQN Variance headline was recalibrated.** It was reading ~74–80% ("within ±10%"), which felt inflated for how strict that band actually is. The qualifying threshold tightened from `accuracy >= 80` to `accuracy >= 89`, landing the headline at ~40–50% at default filters — a real recomputed number, not a hardcoded one. The year-on-year drill-down (`CQN_VARIANCE_BY_FY` in `mockData.js`) is curated static data in the same 40–50% range, since no per-queue-per-year variance dataset exists yet; the queues shown in the year pop-up are real (pulled from the live filtered fact table), just not year-specific yet.

**The year-click pop-up is an actual modal**, the one deliberate exception to the "no modals" rule established in `design_choice.md` — it's a second level of drill-down nested inside the first, and a floating overlay reads better there than trying to cram another chart inline.

## Chart Redesign, Geo Choropleth, RCA/CLCA Sidebar (2026-07-01)

- **Every chart title is now centered at the top of its panel**, and renamed for clarity: "Fiscal Year Plan Variance", "Regional Plan Variance", "Top Queue Variance — Plan A vs Plan B" (Layer 1); "Fiscal Year Adherence", "Forecast Variance Distribution", "Top Queue Variance — Actual vs Plan" (Layer 2); "Global Adherence Heatmap" (Layer 3); plus renamed KPI drill-down titles.
- **Both "CQN Highest Variance" charts are now diverging bar charts** — one bar per queue, extending right (green, ahead of plan) or left (red, behind plan) from zero, instead of two adjacent bars the reader had to compare by eye. Queue names truncate to ~20 chars on the axis (full name still in the tooltip) so long names no longer wrap to two lines and blow out the row spacing.
- **Color roles were tightened**: violet (`#a78bfa`) is now the neutral "trend line" color (Fiscal Year/Regional Plan Variance lines) so it doesn't compete with green/red, which are reserved exclusively for ahead-of-plan/behind-plan semantics on the diverging charts.
- **Forecast Variance Distribution** (renamed from "Adherence Distribution") re-bucketed from accuracy tiers (≥90/80–90/70–80/<70) to variance-magnitude bands (**<10% / 10–20% / 20–30% / >30%**), with a green→blue→amber→red graduated scale and **data labels printed directly on each stacked segment**.
- **Geo Map is a choropleth now, not circle markers.** Countries are filled by their region's (or sub-region's) accuracy color. The "Country" toggle became **"Sub-region"**, showing the real 24 `SUB_REGIONS` values. Country→region/sub-region groupings in `mockData.js` (`regionForCountry`, `subRegionForCountry`) are an illustrative continental/business split, not authoritative geography. In Sub-region view, countries without a specific named sub-region fall back to their parent region's shade at 35% opacity, so named sub-regions visually "pop" against a fully-covered background map instead of leaving most of the world blank.
- **New RCA & CLCA sidebar** — a sticky right-hand column (`RcaClcaPanel.jsx`) running the full height of the dashboard, next to the KPI cards and all three analysis layers. Content is illustrative example findings/actions, clearly labeled as such, until a real RCA workflow is connected.
- **Fixed while verifying:** `cqnActualVariance`'s underlying per-queue `handled` formula previously guaranteed `handled ≤ offered` for every queue, so the "ahead of plan" (green) case in the Layer 2 diverging chart was structurally impossible — no filter combination could ever trigger it. Widened to a symmetric ±8% range and fixed the sort to rank by `|variance|` (it was ranking by raw ascending variance, always surfacing the worst outliers) so the chart now genuinely shows a mix of green and red, matching its own legend.

## Known Issues / Pending

1. **GitHub Pages source must be manually set** to `gh-pages` branch after first deploy (one-time step).
2. **Geo map** fetches world GeoJSON from CDN (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/world-atlas@2`) — requires internet at runtime.
3. Queue/capacity/plan **names** are real; volume, accuracy, and variance **numbers** are still mock/static — no API or database connection yet.
4. Chunk size warning (~697KB bundle) — consider code-splitting recharts and react-simple-maps in future.
5. `INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` (146 real names as of 2026-07-02) is defined in `mockData.js` but has no drill-down UI yet — only the count is shown on the Total Queues card.
6. `LOB_QUEUES`'s real per-queue lists for "High End Storage" now back the HES Forecasting Total Queues card (2026-07-02) — no longer the dead data flagged in the prior note here.
7. HES Forecasting's CPASU Trend region/time drill-down (`cpasuTrendByRegion`) is fully synthetic — no real per-region/per-quarter/per-week ASU/SR dataset exists yet, same "illustrative structure" convention as the rest of this page's mock numbers.
8. HES Forecasting's Total Queues card treats `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']`'s real names as the whole page's queue roster (not scoped to that one LOB) — it's the only real per-queue name data supplied for this page; if real per-LOB queue lists arrive for the other 32 LOBs, this should be revisited to decide whether Total Queues should sum across all of them instead.
9. The light/dark theme toggle (2026-07-02) wasn't visually verified in a rendered browser — this session's environment has no browser-automation tool available. Verified instead by a clean production build, grepping the compiled CSS to confirm both `:root` and `[data-theme='light']` variable blocks made it through Tailwind/PostCSS untouched, and a full-codebase grep confirming no stray hardcoded "chrome" colors (background/border/primary-secondary-muted text) were left unconverted. Worth a manual toggle-and-look pass before treating this as fully verified.
