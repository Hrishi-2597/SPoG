# Project Handoff — TSG SPoG MSG Forecasting Dashboard

## Fixed: Sankey Node Hover Wasn't Firing At All (2026-07-20)

- **Bug:** the node-hover summary added earlier the same day (below) never appeared — reported directly ("When I hover over sankey its not appearing").
- **Root cause:** the `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseLeave` handlers were attached to the wrapping `<g>` in `SankeyNode`, not to any element with real geometry. An SVG `<g>` with no shape of its own doesn't reliably register mouse events — only its painted children do, and hover doesn't bubble up to a geometry-less parent the way click does.
- **Fix:** moved the handlers onto a dedicated, invisible hit-area `<rect>` (the same idiom the Geo Maps already use successfully — handlers directly on the shape, e.g. `<Geography onMouseEnter=...>`, not a wrapper). The hit area is padded ~74px toward the label side (within the chart's 90px margin) so hovering the visible name text triggers it too, not just the thin colored bar. Added `pointerEvents: 'none'` to the visible `Rectangle`/`text` so they don't shadow the hit-area rect underneath.
- Could not visually click-test this (no browser-automation tool in this environment) — the fix is based on a well-understood SVG behavior and matches this app's own working precedent, but flagging that it hasn't been confirmed in a live browser.
- Verified with `npm run build` (clean).

## Three Fixes: DB/OSP Split, Sankey Hover, MoM/QoQ Comparisons (2026-07-20)

**1. DB/OSP Split card fixed (mockData.js `cardData()`):** the split % was computed from `filterQueues(filters)` — which already applies the current DB/OSP pill — so selecting "DB" or "OSP" made every remaining row trivially match itself, always reporting 100%/0%. Now computed from a `{...filters, dbOsp: 'All'}`-scoped row set summed by each queue's real `offered` volume (not queue count), so the split stays a true, stable channel mix (verified via Node smoke test: 66%/34% across All/DB/OSP toggle positions — no more degenerate 100/0) and matches the card's own "Offered volume" sublabel, which a raw queue-count ratio never actually measured.

**2. Sankey hover (TSA Capacity's `WorkloadDistributionLayer.jsx`):** hovering a LOB or CQN node now shows a small list of every node on the other side it connects to, each with its value and % share of the hovered node's total — hover a LOB to see the CQNs it supports and their share of that LOB's volume; hover a CQN to see the LOBs supporting it and their share of that CQN's volume. New `nodeHoverSummary()` helper reads `payload.sourceLinks`/`targetLinks` (already resolved to full node objects, same mechanism the existing link-hover `SankeyTip` already relied on) and sorts by value descending. The existing link-hover Recharts `Tooltip` (one flow at a time) is untouched — this is an additional node-level summary, not a replacement.

**3. MoM/QoQ instead of always YoY — all 3 card pages (`tsaData.js`, `msgCapacityData.js`, `tsaCapacityData.js`):** TSA Forecasting's KPI cards (ASU/SR/CPASU) compared the latest value against the prior FY even when the page's Quarter/Month/Week granularity toggle was set to something else, because `tsaCardData(filters)` never accepted or forwarded `granularity` — that part was a straightforward bug, fixed by threading `granularity` through (`TsaMetricCards.jsx` now calls `tsaCardData(filters, granularity)`). The `yoyPct()`/`prevPeriod` label text was already generic ("vs {prevPeriod}"), so it now automatically reads "vs Apr FY27" or "vs FY27 Q1" once you switch granularity — no label text changes needed.

MSG Capacity and TSA Capacity's card functions, by contrast, had an *explicit prior design decision* to always stay FY-over-FY (documented in their own code comments, reasoning that granular sub-year comparisons "have no real baseline"). Confirmed with the user that the new request should override that decision too — extended the same fix there: `capacityCardData`/`tsaCapacityCardData` now reuse each metric's existing granular selector (`hcStaffingByFY`, `utilizationByFY`, `slTrendByFY`, `attritionByFY`/`tsaAttritionByFY`, `actHrsByFY`) for both the headline value AND the prior-period comparison, instead of a separate FY-only lookup. Added a new `sloByFY(filters, granularity)` to `tsaCapacityData.js` (no granular Global SLO series existed before) and added `bench` to `tsaAttritionByFY`'s rate expansion (needed by the Attrition card, wasn't carried through previously). Fixed a `target` lookup bug this surfaced in `msgCapacityData.js`: `BASE_SL_TARGET`/`BASE_ATTRITION_TARGET` are keyed by bare FY ("FY27"), so once the period became granular ("FY27 Q1") the lookup needed `.slice(0, 4)` first.

Verified all three via a Node smoke test (`capacityCardData`/`tsaCapacityCardData` at Year/Quarter/Month) — periods, targets, and deltas all came back correct, no `NaN`/`undefined`. One caveat, not a bug: MSG Capacity's "Staffing" card shows ~0% Month/Quarter-over-Month/Quarter change, because it's a ratio (`actual/plan`) where `expandToGranularity` applies the *same* wobble to both sides — the ratio is mathematically constant within a fiscal year by construction. Other rate-native metrics (SL%, Attrition%, Global SLO) showed real non-zero movement in the smoke test.

The main MSG/ESG Forecasting page's cards don't show any period-over-period comparison at all, so this fix doesn't apply there (matches the request's "where applicable").

## Geo Maps: Click a Region to Spotlight It (2026-07-20)

- **All 4 Geo Maps** (`Layer3GeoMap.jsx`, `TsaGeoMap.jsx`, `MsgCapacityGeoMap.jsx`, `TsaCapacityGeoMap.jsx`) previously showed every region/sub-region colored at full weight simultaneously, with hover-only tooltips and no way to isolate one. Clicking a region/sub-region (on the map OR its row in the summary table below) now spotlights just that one: it stays at full color/opacity with an accent-colored highlighted border, every other region dims to ~10% opacity. Click the same one again, click the "Clear" text that appears next to the subtitle, or toggle Region/Sub-region view to go back to showing everything.
- New `selectedKey` state per map component; the summary table's rows are now clickable too (not just hover-highlighted) and bold+tint the selected row, giving two ways to select the same thing.
- Switching Region/Sub-region view (on the 3 maps that have that toggle) clears the selection, since the two views key off different name domains (a region name wouldn't match anything in sub-region rows, or vice versa). `MsgCapacityGeoMap`'s Headcount/SL% metric toggle does NOT clear the selection — same area, just a different metric coloring it.
- Verified with `npm run build` (clean).

## Fixed: Card Insight Popup Clipped Vertically (CLCA Cut Off) (2026-07-20)

- **Bug:** after the right-alignment fix (above), the popup opened in the correct horizontal position but its bottom (the CLCA section) was still getting clipped — reported via screenshot showing "CLCA" label visible but its text cut off below.
- **Root cause:** `.card-panel` (the KPI card's own CSS class) had `overflow: hidden`, added for rounded-corner clipping. Since the insight popup renders as a child of the card (needed so it's positioned relative to the card), the card's own `overflow: hidden` was clipping the popup whenever it grew taller than the card itself.
- **Fix:** removed `overflow: hidden` from `.card-panel` in `index.css`. Nothing else in the card relies on it — the top `::before` glow bar and the bottom active-state gradient bar are already inset within the card's width and don't overflow it.
- Verified with `npm run build` (clean).

## Fixed: Card Insight Popup Clipped Off-Screen (2026-07-20)

- **Bug:** on all 20 KPI cards, the "i" button sits at the card's top-right corner, but `GraphInsightButton`'s popup always anchored its left edge to the button (`left: 0`) — for a 220px-wide popup opening from a top-right-corner button, that pushes most of the popup off the right edge of the screen/card, clipping the RCA/CLCA text (reported via screenshot: only slivers of "RCA"/"CLCA" text visible at the right edge).
- **Fix:** `GraphInsightButton` (`ChartKit.jsx`) takes a new optional `align` prop (`'left'` default, `'right'`) controlling whether the popup anchors via `left: 0` or `right: 0`. All 4 card files (`MetricCards.jsx`, `TsaMetricCards.jsx`, `MsgCapacityMetricCards.jsx`, `TsaCapacityMetricCards.jsx`) now pass `align="right"` so the popup opens leftward from the top-right button, staying within the card. Graphs and Geo Maps (button on the left) are untouched — still default to `align="left"`.
- Verified with `npm run build` (clean).

## Removed the RCA/CLCA Sidebar — Per-Graph "i" Button Is Now the Only RCA/Insights Surface (2026-07-20)

- **Deleted the sticky right-hand RCA/CLCA sidebar panel from all 4 pages** (`RcaClcaPanel.jsx`, `TsaRcaClcaPanel.jsx`, `MsgCapacityRcaClcaPanel.jsx`, `TsaCapacityRcaClcaPanel.jsx` — all 4 files removed entirely, no longer imported anywhere). Each page's `flex` row (main content + 220px sticky sidebar) collapsed back to a single full-width column.
- **No new component was needed** — every graph and card already had the per-visual `GraphInsightButton` "i" popup (built 2026-07-10, see below), which was the intended replacement mechanism. This change only removes the now-redundant sidebar; RCA/CLCA content itself is unchanged and still lives on each graph/card's own popup.
- **Verified**: `npm run build` clean (1174 modules, down from 1178 — the 4 deleted files); grep confirms zero remaining `RcaClcaPanel` references anywhere in `src/`.

## Per-Card RCA/CLCA Popup — Every KPI Card on All 4 Pages (2026-07-10)

- **Extended the same small "i" popup to every KPI card** (20 total: 5 cards × 4 pages), matching the per-graph treatment added earlier the same day. Same `GraphInsightButton`, same one-RCA-sentence + one-CLCA-sentence content shape.
- **Each page's local `Card` component changed from a `<button>` to a `<div role="button" tabIndex={0}>`** — the whole card is still fully clickable/keyboard-accessible (Enter/Space trigger it), but this was necessary so the new insight button (itself a real `<button>`) isn't nested inside another `<button>`, which is invalid. The insight button's wrapper stops click propagation so tapping it doesn't also toggle the card's own drill-down modal.
- Touched `MetricCards.jsx` (MSG Forecasting), `TsaMetricCards.jsx` (TSA Forecasting — picks up `GraphInsightButton` automatically via `TsaChartKit.jsx`'s existing re-export), `MsgCapacityMetricCards.jsx`, `TsaCapacityMetricCards.jsx`.
- **Verified**: `npm run build` clean; grep sweep confirming 6 `rca=` matches per file (1 destructure signature + 5 card call sites) across all 4 files — no card missed.

## Per-Graph RCA/CLCA Popup — Every Chart on All 4 Pages (2026-07-10)

- **New small "i" button on every graph** (35 charts total: 31 chart-panel visuals + 4 Geo Maps), across all 4 pages — MSG Forecasting, TSA Forecasting, MSG Capacity Plan, TSA Capacity Plan. Clicking it opens a compact popup with one RCA sentence and one CLCA sentence specific to that graph's own metric — deliberately small ("don't exaggerate it"), not a repeat of the page-level RCA/CLCA sidebar's paragraph-length bullets.
- **New shared `GraphInsightButton` component** (`src/components/ChartKit.jsx`) — a 17px circular "i" toggle + popup, reusing the existing `.chart-tooltip` styling. Wired into the shared `Visual` wrapper via two new optional props (`rca`, `clca`); any chart using `Visual` gets the button for free just by passing those two strings. Sits in the visual's top-left corner, deliberately opposite `cornerControls` (top-right), which many visuals already use for Region/Sub-region toggles.
- **MSG Forecasting's `Layer1PlanOverPlan.jsx`/`Layer2ActualVsPlan.jsx` predate the shared `ChartKit.jsx` promotion** and still keep their own local `Visual` definitions — rather than migrating them to the shared component (riskier, given each has its own local color-role constants and `Tip` formatting), the same `rca`/`clca` prop handling was added directly to their own local `Visual`, importing only `GraphInsightButton` from `ChartKit.jsx`.
- **The 4 Geo Maps** (`Layer3GeoMap.jsx`, `TsaGeoMap.jsx`, `MsgCapacityGeoMap.jsx`, `TsaCapacityGeoMap.jsx`) don't use `Visual` at all (custom layer-header layout) — `GraphInsightButton` was placed directly in each one's own toggle row, positioned via `justify-content: space-between` so it never collides with the existing Region/Sub-region (or dual metric+view) toggles.
- **Verified**: `npm run build` clean; grep sweep confirming exactly 35 `rca=`/`clca=` pairs (one per graph, no chart missed, no orphaned prop without its pair).

## Forecast Accuracy Drill-Down: Year-Wise Default, Click-to-Region Pop-Up (2026-07-08)

- **Default view flipped from region to fiscal year.** `ForecastByFYChart` (Actual/Forecast bars + Accuracy% line, by FY) replaces the old always-region view as the Forecast Accuracy card's default drill-down chart.
- **Clicking a year's bar opens a new nested pop-up** (`ForecastYearRegionModal`) showing that year's regional breakdown — the same Actual/Forecast/Accuracy% chart shape as before, now scoped to one fiscal year and reached by drilling in, mirroring the CQN Variance card's existing "click a year for detail" pattern in this same file.
- New selectors in `mockData.js`: `forecastAccuracyByFY(filters)` (FY rollup of the existing region baseline, nudged per year — forecast held flat across years, only actual/accuracy move) and `forecastAccuracyByRegionForYear(filters, fy)` (region breakdown for one year, using the same per-year nudge so the two views' totals reconcile). The old un-scoped `forecastAccuracyByRegion` was removed as dead code once nothing called it anymore.
- **Verified**: Node smoke test confirming the FY rollup narrows correctly by Fiscal Year/Region filters, and that a given year's region-breakdown totals reconcile with that year's FY-rollup row (forecast sums exactly, actual sums within a rounding tolerance); `npm run build` clean.

## DB/OSP Split Drill-Down: Column Chart → Line Chart (2026-07-08)

- `MetricCards.jsx`'s `DbOspByFYChart` (DB/OSP Split card's popup) changed from grouped columns to a line chart — same two series (DB Offered / OSP Offered), same colors, now plotted as trend lines.

## Call Volume Drill-Down: Holiday Calendar Added (2026-07-08)

- New "Holiday Calendar" table added below the Offered/Handled/Abandon % chart in the Call Volume card's popup — real public holidays (New Year's Day, Republic Day, Lunar New Year, Good Friday, Labour Day, Independence Day ×2, Diwali, Thanksgiving, Christmas) paired with their real country, illustrative dates (not tied to a specific calendar year, since offered/handled volume isn't broken out by holiday in the underlying mock data). Context for why offered volume/abandon rate swings around these dates.
- `HOLIDAY_CALENDAR` lives directly in `MetricCards.jsx` (not `mockData.js`) since it's static reference content nothing filters or computes off of — same placement convention as the RCA/CLCA panels' own illustrative content.

## Call Volume Card Face + Drill-Down: Handled % Replaced With Abandon % Everywhere (2026-07-08)

- `MetricCards.jsx`'s `VolumeByFYChart` (the Call Volume card's popup) plots **Abandon %** — `(offered - handled) / offered * 100` — instead of Handled %, on the same second axis/line role.
- **Follow-up the same day**: the card's own default-view face text ("177.2K handled · 94.1%") also switched from Handled % to Abandon % ("177.2K handled · 5.9% abandoned"). `cardData()`'s `callVolume` now carries both `handlePct` and `abandonPct` (the latter is just `100 - handlePct`, computed directly rather than derived, so it stays correct if the underlying formula ever changes independently). The card's green/red status threshold was reframed from `handlePct >= 90` to the equivalent `abandonPct <= 10` — same behavior, expressed in the metric now shown.

## Fix: Business Partner Breakdown Hover Tooltip Was Clipped (2026-07-08)

- **The `HoverCount` queue-name popup (added earlier the same day) was being clipped** by its own table's wrapper `<div>`, which had `overflowX: 'auto'` — per the CSS spec, setting only one of `overflow-x`/`overflow-y` to a non-`visible` value silently resolves the other to `'auto'` too (they can't be split when either isn't `visible`), so that div was clipping vertical overflow even though only horizontal scroll was intended. Fixed by dropping the wrapper's overflow styling entirely — the table is only 4 narrow columns, so horizontal scroll was never actually needed, and the Modal itself already scrolls vertically if the popup runs long.
- Also flipped the tooltip's popup direction from above the row (`bottom: 130%`) to below it (`top: calc(100% + 6px)`), since opening downward has more room to clear in practice.

## MSG Forecasting: Total Queues Drill-Down Now Shows Active + Inactive + BP Breakdown (2026-07-08)

- **New `INACTIVE_QUEUES` fact table** (`mockData.js`) — the 146 inactive queue names, previously just a flat list with no attributes, are now tagged with `region` (same `inferRegion()` regex as `ACTIVE_QUEUES`) and `businessPartner` (round-robin over the real `BUSINESS_PARTNERS` list) — same "real names + illustrative structure" convention as everywhere else in this app.
- **Region donut now shows both active and inactive queues.** A new All/Active/Inactive segmented pill (reusing the `.drill-toggle` pattern) sits above it; whichever view is selected drives the pie itself, but the big center number is now always followed by an "X active · Y inactive" line, and every slice's hover tooltip shows that region's Active/Inactive split too — so both are visible regardless of which view is toggled on.
- **The queue table below the donut now lists both active and inactive queues** (region-filtered by the donut, like before), with a new Status badge column; inactive rows show "—" for Accuracy since that concept doesn't exist for them.
- **New "Business Partner Breakdown" table** underneath — one row per Business Partner with Active / Inactive / Total columns. **Hovering the Active or Inactive count shows a popup listing the actual queue names** behind that number (new `HoverCount` component, styled like every other hover tooltip in the app).
- New selectors in `mockData.js`: `allQueuesByStatus(filters)` (combined active+inactive rows tagged with `status`, narrowed by region/businessPartner — the two dimensions the inactive roster actually carries) and `queuesByBusinessPartner(filters)` (per-BP active/inactive counts + the queue-name arrays behind each count).
- **Verified**: Node smoke test confirming the inactive roster's tagging, that `allQueuesByStatus` correctly narrows both rosters by region/businessPartner, and that the BP breakdown's active/inactive counts and name arrays sum back to the full roster; `npm run build` clean.

## RCA/CLCA Sidebar Compacted + TSA ACT Trend Adherence Line Removed (2026-07-06)

- **RCA/CLCA sidebar narrowed from 300px to 220px** on all 4 business pages (`ForecastingPage.jsx`, `TsaForecastingPage.jsx`, `MsgCapacityPage.jsx`, `TsaCapacityPage.jsx`) — the sidebar's fixed width was squeezing the 3-visual-per-row Analysis Layers into a cramped remaining space, most visibly on TSA Capacity's Workload Distribution layer (Sankey + 2 charts). All 4 pages' RCA/CLCA panel content (`RcaClcaPanel.jsx`, `TsaRcaClcaPanel.jsx`, `MsgCapacityRcaClcaPanel.jsx`, `TsaCapacityRcaClcaPanel.jsx`) had their shared `Section` component's type/padding/spacing scaled down to match (badge 9→8px, title 11.5→10px, subtitle 9.5→8.5px, list items 11→9.5px with tighter line-height and gaps) so the narrower column doesn't itself feel cramped.
- **Removed the Adherence % line from TSA Capacity's "ACT Trend — Actual vs Plan"** (`WorkloadDistributionLayer.jsx` Visual3) — its right-hand axis was dropped along with it. "Average Case Time Variance" (Visual2) still carries its own Adherence % line; only the chart literally titled "ACT Trend" had it removed, per the request's specific wording ("the ACT graph").

## Header "Live" Badge: FY26 → FY27 (2026-07-06)

- The header's "Live · FY26" indicator (`App.jsx`) is shared markup rendered once above every page (landing + all 4 business pages), so updating the single hardcoded string to "Live · FY27" fixed it everywhere in one edit — verified via grep that no other file has a "Live · FYxx" occurrence to keep in sync.

## TSA Capacity Plan: Full Revision Pass — Filters, YTD Cards, Drills, Workload, Geo Map, RCA/CLCA (2026-07-03)

A detailed revision pass on TSA Capacity Plan, largely mirroring the MSG Capacity Plan revision pass but adapted to this page's LOB-based data model. Also fixed a shared filter list used by TSA Forecasting too.

- **Global Grouping filter corrected**: `GLOBAL_GROUPING_LIST` (`tsaData.js`, shared by both TSA pages) replaced the earlier inferred `['Consumer','Commercial','Enterprise']` with the real business-confirmed list `['COMPUTE/NETWORKING', 'DPU/UDX', 'HCX', 'OTHER', 'PRIMARY/MIDRANGE']` — affects TSA Forecasting's Global Grouping filter too, since both pages share this constant.
- **Cards**: "Total FTE" → **Staffing Summary**, "Global SLO" → **SLO %**. All 4 relevant cards (Staffing Summary, Attrition %, Avg Case Time, SLO %) now show a YTD/YoY sub-message via the same `ytdSub` pattern used on the other two pages; Attrition and Avg Case Time invert the color logic (an increase YoY is red). Cases per FTE is unchanged. Card headline values now drill with the granularity slicer.
- **"Headcount and Attrition" layer renamed "Headcount and Utilization."** Visual1 renamed **"Actual vs Plan Variation"** (line renamed "Variation %"). Visual2 Attrition reworked into a real Region/Sub-region click-to-drill chart (mirroring MSG Capacity's), with a tooltip showing the raw attritted-employee count alongside the %. Visual3 renamed **"Utilization Variance"**, its cosmetic "Country" lens relabeled "Sub-region" now that a real sub-region dimension exists on this page's LOB fact table.
- **"Plan over Plan Comparison" replaced with a new TSA-specific "Plan over Plan Variation" layer** (`tsaCapacity/PlanOverPlanVariationLayer.jsx`), mirroring MSG Capacity's Region/Sub-region drill + ranked-variance-list structure, but ranking **LOBs** instead of queues (this page has no per-queue dimension). The shared `capacity/PlanOverPlanLayer.jsx` component is now unused by either Capacity page and was deleted.
- **Workload Distribution layer**: Visual1 renamed **"Workload Distribution"**, gained an **LOB/CQN toggle** — LOB mode flows illustrative CQN tiers into real LOB names (unchanged), CQN mode flows illustrative LOB tiers into 4 real TSA queue names pulled from `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']`. Visual2 (previously "Workload Act vs Plan," which used workload-hours data) renamed **"Average Case Time Variance"** and repointed at the Average Case Time metric (bar chart + a new Adherence % line + a "top LOBs above target" list) — its original workload-hours data (`workloadByFY`/`WORKLOAD_BY_FY`) is no longer used anywhere and was removed. Visual3 "ACT Trend — Actual vs Plan" kept as a line trend but gained the same Adherence % line and defaulter-LOB list.
- **Geo Map now has a Region/Sub-region toggle** ("worldwide SLO... region and sub-region wise"), mirroring MSG Capacity's exact fallback-to-parent-region-at-35%-opacity mechanic.
- **New RCA & CLCA sidebar** (`TsaCapacityRcaClcaPanel.jsx`), same sticky layout as the other 3 pages, content written for this page's staffing/attrition/Cases-per-FTE/Average-Case-Time/SLO vocabulary.
- **Verified**: extended Node smoke test covering every new/changed selector (subRegion tagging, YTD/YoY at all 4 granularities, Attrition/Plan-over-Plan region+sub-region drill, Sankey LOB/CQN mode shapes including confirming the 4 real queue names actually exist in `LOB_QUEUES`, ACT adherence + defaulter-LOB sort order, sub-region geo data) — all passing. `npm run build` clean (1178 modules).

## MSG Capacity Plan: Cases per FTE Card + RCA/CLCA Sidebar (2026-07-03)

- **"Total FTE" card replaced with "Cases per FTE."** New icon (📋), value is the latest in-scope FY's actual cases-per-FTE figure. New `CPF_BY_FY` baseline + `cpfByFY(filters, granularity)` selector in `msgCapacityData.js` (rate-preserving expansion, same reasoning as UCR target/current). `capacityCardData` dropped `totalFte` entirely and added `casesPerFte: {actual, plan, period}`.
- **This card shows YTD only** — its sub-line reads `YTD FY27: 16.8`, with no YoY comparison or trend pip, unlike every other card on this page (a deliberate one-card exception to the `ytdSub` pattern, per direct request).
- **Its popup shows Actual vs Plan** as two lines (new `CasesPerFteTrendChart`), not a single-metric trend — per "when pop-up opens it should show cases per FTE actual and Plan."
- **New RCA & CLCA sidebar** (`MsgCapacityRcaClcaPanel.jsx`) — sticky right-hand column alongside the 4 analysis layers, same layout mechanism (starts at the "Analysis Layers" divider, KPI cards stay full-width) as MSG Forecasting's `RcaClcaPanel`/TSA Forecasting's `TsaRcaClcaPanel`. Content is illustrative and written specifically for this page's own metrics (staffing/utilization/SL/attrition/cases-per-FTE vocabulary), not a copy of either Forecasting page's copy, per the standing convention.
- **Verified**: Node smoke test confirming `casesPerFte` is present/numeric at all 4 granularities and `totalFte` no longer appears in card data; `npm run build` clean (1177 modules); grep sweep confirmed no stray `totalFte`/`'fte'` references remain in the MSG Capacity component tree.

## MSG Capacity Plan: Filters, Cards, Attrition/Plan-over-Plan Drill, Aux Detail (2026-07-03)

A detailed revision pass on the MSG Capacity Plan page only (TSA Capacity, both Forecasting pages, and the landing page are unaffected):

- **Filters**: Plan Name now uses MSG Forecasting's own `PLAN_NAMES` list (was a page-specific `CAPACITY_PLAN_NAMES`), defaulting to "All" like every other filter (no more pre-selected `'Actual'`). **Business Org filter removed entirely.** **Country filter removed**, replaced by **Sub-region** (the same real 24-value `SUB_REGIONS` list MSG Forecasting uses) — `CAPACITY_QUEUES` now carries a `subRegion` tag read directly off `ACTIVE_QUEUES[i]` so a queue's sub-region matches on both pages.
- **Cards now show a YTD/YoY sub-message** instead of a static target/plan line, e.g. `YTD FY27: 95% · ▼ 2.1% vs FY26` — same pattern as TSA Forecasting's cards. Total FTE and Attrition invert the color logic (an increase YoY is flagged red, a decrease green — for both, growth is the bad direction). Card headline values now drill with the page-wide Quarter/Month/Week granularity toggle; the YoY comparison itself stays FY-over-FY regardless of granularity (same split TSA Forecasting's cards use).
- **"Actual vs Planned HC Staffing Summary" renamed "Actual vs Plan Variation"**, its trend line renamed "Staffing %" → "Variation %", and its Plan selector now offers `PLAN_NAMES` instead of the page-specific plan list.
- **Attrition visual reworked**: now a Region/Sub-region-level default view (one bar+line per key), and clicking a key drills into that key's own FY/granularity trend — same "click a region to drill" mechanic as TSA Forecasting's CPASU Trend. The tooltip now also shows the raw attritted-employee count alongside the %, not just the percentage.
- **"Actual vs Plan Trend with SL%" renamed "Headcount Impact on SL"**; its Region/Country toggle was removed; the defaulter list below now requires **both** actual HC > plan **and** SL% < 90 (previously just over-plan HC) — a queue merely over plan with healthy SL no longer shows up.
- **"Plan over Plan Headcount Comparison" replaced with a new MSG-specific "Plan over Plan Variation" layer** (`PlanOverPlanVariationLayer.jsx`, no longer the shared `capacity/PlanOverPlanLayer.jsx` — TSA Capacity keeps using the shared one, unchanged): a Region/Sub-region toggle with the same click-to-drill mechanic as Attrition, plus a new **"Queues with Highest Variation"** diverging ranked bar chart (value-labeled, worst first) — the page's headline visual per direct request.
- **Utilization layer renamed "Utilization and Outage Analysis"**. "Actual vs Target Utilization" now shows the top 3 Aux codes driving any shortfall (not just one) plus a new Adherence % trend line. "Queues with Aux Culprit" renamed **"Utilization Defaulter Queues"**, now listing 2-3 Aux codes per queue instead of one. "Outage — Actual vs Target Leaves" renamed **"Leave Impact — Actual vs Target"**.
- **Geo Map's Country toggle replaced with Sub-region**, mirroring MSG Forecasting's own Geo Map fallback mechanic (unmapped countries shade at their parent region's color, 35% opacity, suppressed once Region/Sub-region filters already narrow the view).
- **Verified**: extended Node smoke test covering every new/changed selector (subRegion tagging, YTD/YoY at all 4 granularities, Attrition/Plan-over-Plan region+sub-region drill at Year/Quarter, SL-defaulter dual condition, queue-variance sort order, 3-aux breakdown sort order, sub-region geo data) — all passing. `npm run build` clean (1176 modules).

## Landing Page + MSG/TSA Capacity Plan Pages (2026-07-03)

- **The app is now 4 pages, not 2.** A new "TSG SPoG" landing screen with two tiles (**MSG**, **TSA**) is the entry point; clicking a tile opens that business section, which has its own internal Forecasting/Capacity Plan toggle in the header. A **home button** (next to the logo) takes you back to the landing tiles from either business section. Each business remembers its own last-viewed sub-page independently — hopping to the other business and back doesn't reset it.
- **`MSG Capacity Plan`** (`src/components/msgCapacity/`, `src/data/msgCapacityData.js`) — new page, 5 KPI cards (Staffing Summary, Utilization %, SL %, Total FTE, Attrition %) + 4 layers: **01 Headcount and SL%** (staffing summary, attrition, actual-vs-plan-with-SL% + defaulter-queue list), **02 Plan over Plan Comparison** (shared layer, see below), **03 Utilization** (actual-vs-target time trend with Aux-code culprit tooltip, per-queue Aux-culprit ranking, outage/leaves ranking), **04 Geo Map** (dual toggle: Headcount/SL% metric × Region/Country view).
- **`TSA Capacity Plan`** (`src/components/tsaCapacity/`, `src/data/tsaCapacityData.js`) — new page, reuses TSA Forecasting's own filter set and `TsaFilterPanel.jsx`/LOB fact table directly (identical fields: LOB, FY/Qtr/Month/Week, Business Partner, Global Grouping). 5 KPI cards (Total FTE, Attrition %, Cases per FTE, Avg Case Time, Global SLO) + 4 layers: **01 Headcount and Attrition** (staffing summary, attrition, actual-vs-plan utilization), **02 Plan over Plan Comparison** (shared layer), **03 Workload Distribution** (new **Sankey diagram** — CQN priority tiers → real LOBs — plus workload and ACT-hours trend charts), **04 Geo Map** (single-metric SLO-by-region choropleth).
- **New shared `src/components/capacity/PlanOverPlanLayer.jsx`** — the "Plan over Plan Headcount Comparison" layer is identical on both Capacity pages (Plan A/B dropdowns, bar+variance-line chart); built once, takes a `dataFn(filters, granularity)` prop so each page supplies its own selector (`planOverPlanHCByFY` for MSG, `planOverPlanFteByFY` for TSA).
- **`ChartKit.jsx` promoted to a shared top-level component** (`src/components/ChartKit.jsx`) out of `TsaChartKit.jsx`, which now just re-exports it — both Forecasting pages and both new Capacity pages share one implementation of `Visual`/`Tip`/`PlanDropdowns`/`PlanSelect`/`CategoryTick`/`truncate`, plus a new `BinaryToggle` (generic two-state pill switch, used by every Region/Country-style toggle across both Capacity pages' layers and geo maps).
- **New shared data constants** in `mockData.js`: `CAPACITY_PLAN_NAMES` (`Actual`/`Dec Plan`/`Jan Plan`/`April Plan`), `BUSINESS_ORGS`, `COUNTRIES` (14 real countries) + `COUNTRY_REGION` lookup — back MSG Capacity's plan selectors and Country-view geo map.
- **TSA Capacity's Geo Map renumbering**: the source mockup labels it "Layer 5" but shows no "Layer 4" at all — renumbered to badge **04** in the UI to keep this page's layer badges sequential (01→02→03→04), same as every other page in the app.
- **Verification:** both new data modules (`msgCapacityData.js`, `tsaCapacityData.js`) were Node-smoke-tested directly (every selector, every granularity, filter-narrowing behavior) before any UI was built on top of them — this caught two real sorting bugs (see Known Issues). `npm run build` succeeds cleanly with everything wired into `App.jsx` (1175 modules). This session's environment has no browser-automation tool, so the landing tiles/toggles/Sankey diagram weren't visually clicked through by the agent — the dev server was started and opened in the user's browser for manual verification instead.

## Granularity Toggle: Default Back to Fiscal Year (2026-07-02)

- **Fixed the default view.** The View By toggle shipped defaulting to "Quarter" (so every chart rendered 12 quarterly bars instead of 3 FY bars out of the box) — corrected so nothing is pre-selected by default, same as every other filter defaulting to "All." No selection = Fiscal Year, exactly matching every chart's pre-toggle behavior.
- **Clicking the active option now toggles it off** back to the Fiscal Year default, instead of the pill always having exactly one of Quarter/Month/Week active (unlike the DB/OSP pill, which is a genuine 3-way exclusive choice with no "off" state).
- Fixed a latent bug this surfaced: `tsaData.js`'s `regionTrendGranularity()` had a `= 'Quarter'` default *parameter*, which only applies when the argument is omitted entirely — since the real caller now explicitly passes `null` (not `undefined`), that default silently never fired, and `null` was falling through `periodsForGranularity()`'s branching straight to the Quarter list. Fixed by explicitly checking for a falsy/`'Year'` value and returning the plain fiscal years in that case, matching every other selector's convention.
- Re-verified with the same throwaway-Node-script approach as the original feature: confirmed `planOverPlanByFY`, `actualVsPlanByFY`, `asuByFY`, `ucrByFY` all return plain `['FY25','FY26','FY27']` period lists both when `granularity` is omitted and when it's explicitly `null`, and that `regionTrendGranularity(filters, null)` now returns `{ granularity: 'Year', periods: ['FY25','FY26','FY27'] }` instead of silently defaulting to quarters.

## Global Time-Granularity Toggle (Quarter/Month/Week) for Both Pages (2026-07-02)

- **New page-wide "View By" control** — a Quarter/Month/Week pill toggle placed at the top-right of each page's filter bar (in the same row as the value-filter clusters, after a divider) — changes what axis granularity every time-series chart renders at, on both MSG Forecasting and TSA Forecasting. Default: Quarter. State lives in `ForecastingPage.jsx`/`TsaForecastingPage.jsx` alongside `filters`, passed down to every chart that needs it.
- **Placement researched, not guessed** — page-wide view settings (as opposed to value filters that narrow rows) conventionally live in the same horizontal toolbar as the other filters, prominently and persistently visible, often paired with or near a date/time control. See `design_choice.md` for the write-up and sources.
- **New shared math in `mockData.js`**: `FISCAL_MONTH_LIST` (moved here from `tsaData.js`, which now imports and re-exports it — no other file needed to change), `periodsForGranularity()`, `expandToGranularity()` (for additive/volume fields — divides an FY value across its sub-periods with a small deterministic wobble), and `expandRateToGranularity()` (for percentage/rate fields like UCR target/current — keeps the same magnitude across sub-periods instead of dividing, since a rate isn't additive).
- **Every period-keyed chart on both pages now takes a `granularity` argument**: MSG's `planOverPlanByFY`, `actualVsPlanByFY`, `stackedAdherenceByFY`, `callVolumeByFY`, `dbOspVolumeByFY`; TSA's `asuByFY`, `srByFY`, `asuPlanVsPlanByFY`, `srPlanVsPlanByFY`, `cpasuByFY`, `ucrByFY`, `srBotsByFY`, `srDbOspByFY`, and the CPASU Trend region-drill (`regionTrendGranularity`/`cpasuTrendByRegion`, which now takes the global toggle value instead of inferring granularity from which time filter happened to be selected). Region-axis and queue/LOB-axis charts (Plan Impact, Top Queues by Variance, Geo Maps, LOB donuts) are unaffected by design — there's no "week" of a region.
- **Supersedes two recent decisions**: TSA's "UCR Runrate with Target" chart was fixed to always show Fiscal Year (2026-07-02, earlier the same day) — it now responds to the granularity toggle like everything else. `topNonAdherentLobsByYear()` was generalized to accept any period label (`FY27`, `FY27Q2`, `FY27M03`, `FY27W14`), deriving the target year via the first 4 characters, since clicking a bar can now surface a non-year period.
- **Verified numerically** (not just via build) with a throwaway Node script exercising every changed selector at Quarter/Month/Week: correct period counts (12/36/156), sub-period volumes summing back close to the original FY totals, rate fields (UCR target/current) staying in their original range instead of being divided down, and the region-drill/LOB-modal functions handling non-year period labels correctly.

## Filter Bar Gap Fix + Light/Dark Theme Toggle (2026-07-02)

- **Fixed a layout bug on TSA Forecasting's filter bar**: the Time cluster (Fiscal Year/Quarter/Month/Week) left a visible empty gap before the People cluster (Business Partner/Global Grouping). Root cause: `TsaFilterPanel.jsx`'s `Cluster` grid div was missing `flex-1 min-w-0` — the Forecasting page's `FilterPanel.jsx` already had this on its own `Cluster`, so its clusters correctly stretch to fill the row; TSA's didn't, so its Time cluster's outer flex-grow allocation went unused as blank space instead of being consumed by the grid inside it. One-line fix.
- **Added a light/dark theme toggle for both pages.** New sun/moon pill switch in the header (next to the MSG/TSA page toggle), persisted to `localStorage`, applied via a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`.
  - New `src/index.css` CSS custom-property system: `:root` (dark, default) and `[data-theme='light']` define `--bg-page/panel/raised/inset`, `--border-subtle/default/strong`, `--text-primary/secondary/dim/faint/muted`, `--accent` (+`--accent-contrast` for text-on-accent), `--tooltip-bg`, `--chart-grid`, `--select-bg`, `--scrollbar-*`, `--shadow-card*`.
  - Every shared CSS class (`.card-panel`, `.chart-panel`, `.layer-header`, `.select-dark`, `.ms-*`, `.filter-chip`, `.drill-toggle`/`.drill-btn`, `.chart-tooltip`, scrollbars) now reads these variables instead of hardcoded hex, so both pages re-skin from one place.
  - Every component's inline "chrome" colors (backgrounds, borders, primary/secondary/muted text) were rerouted to `var(--...)` across `App.jsx`, `SectionDivider.jsx`, `FilterPanel.jsx`/`TsaFilterPanel.jsx`, `MultiSelectField.jsx`, `MetricCards.jsx`/`TsaMetricCards.jsx`, `Modal.jsx`, `RcaClcaPanel.jsx`/`TsaRcaClcaPanel.jsx`, `TsaChartKit.jsx`, and all 7 layer/geo-map files (`Layer1PlanOverPlan`, `Layer2ActualVsPlan`, `Layer3GeoMap`, `AsuLayer`, `SrLayer`, `AsuSrTrendLayer`, `TsaGeoMap`).
  - **Deliberately left static (same color in both themes):** chart series colors (accent/orange/violet/green/red role assignments), region color palettes, the geo accuracy color scale, status badges, and the geo map's own canvas (background/country fills/borders) — see `design_choice.md` for the reasoning per category.

## MSG Forecasting: Corrected Queue Roster (2026-07-02)

- **`ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` and `INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` (`mockData.js`) were replaced wholesale** with a corrected, business-supplied roster: **47 active** (down from 199) and **146 inactive** (down from 406, including `'CCC MidRange Mandarin'` — moved here from the prior active list). Total Queues: 193 (was 605).
- No code changes were needed beyond the two array literals — every selector (`filterQueues`, `callVolumeByFY`, `dbOspVolumeByFY`, `cardData`, the CQN-variance charts, etc.) reads `ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES.length`/`ACTIVE_QUEUES.length` dynamically rather than a hardcoded count, so the whole filtering/scaling pipeline picked up the new roster automatically.
- Verified no duplicate names within either list and no overlap between the two lists (scripted check, not just eyeballing).
- Region tagging (`inferRegion()`) still resolves sensibly against the new names — no `NAMER` entries in the new active list, which is fine (the Total Queues donut and Geo Map already handle a region having zero/no data).

## Forecasting Page: Card Drill-Downs Are Now Modals Too (2026-07-02)

- **`MetricCards.jsx`'s 5 card drill-downs (Total Queues, Call Volume, DB/OSP Split, Forecast Accuracy, CQN Variance) now open in a popup modal**, matching the behavior already shipped for TSA Forecasting's cards. Closing the modal only clears local `active` state — `filters` (owned by `ForecastingPage`) is untouched, so the dashboard is exactly as filtered when it closes.
- **`Modal` extracted to a shared `src/components/Modal.jsx`**, used by both pages. `src/components/tsa/TsaChartKit.jsx` now re-exports it (`export { Modal } from '../Modal'`) instead of defining its own copy — no TSA import needed to change.
- The nested **CQN Variance year-click modal (`YearQueueModal`)** is unchanged in implementation — it's now a modal nested inside a modal instead of nested inside an inline panel, which needed no code changes to keep working.

## TSA Forecasting: Total Queues Card + RCA/CLCA Sidebar (2026-07-02)

- **Total Queues card added at the front of the Key Metrics row**, mirroring the Forecasting page's card exactly (icon, "Active / Inactive" sublabel, `71 / 221` value format, "150 inactive queues" sub-line). **UCR Impacted SR (the last card) was removed** to make room — the row is back to 5 cards: Total Queues, Active Service Units, Service Requests, CPASU, Current UCR.
- **Data source:** `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']`'s real 71 active / ~150 inactive queue names — previously treated as one LOB's queue sample, now used as the page-level "TSA queue roster" for this card, since it's the only real per-queue name data this page has. New exports in `tsaData.js`: `TSA_ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES`, `TSA_INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES`, `TSA_ACTIVE_QUEUES` (each active name tagged with a region via `inferRegion()`, newly exported from `mockData.js`). `tsaCardData()` gained a `totalQueues` field; it doesn't respond to any filter (no per-queue lob/businessPartner/globalGrouping tags exist to narrow by).
- **Drill-down is a region donut + table**, same mechanic as the Forecasting page's Total Queues card: click a slice (or legend entry) to narrow the table below to that region, click again or "Clear" to reset. Table shows Queue + Region (no Accuracy column — that concept doesn't exist for TSA queues, so it wasn't included just to visually match).
- **`ucrImpactedSrByFY()` removed** as dead code along with the card that used it.
- **New RCA & CLCA sidebar** (`TsaRcaClcaPanel.jsx`) — sticky right-hand column alongside Layers 1-4 (AsuLayer/SrLayer/AsuSrTrendLayer/TsaGeoMap), same layout mechanism as the Forecasting page's `RcaClcaPanel` (starts at the "Analysis Layers" divider, KPI cards stay full-width). Content is illustrative and written specifically for this page's own metrics (ASU/SR/CPASU/UCR/LOB language) rather than reusing the Forecasting page's queue/call-volume-themed copy, per the standing decision documented in `design_choice.md` not to copy that content verbatim.

## TSA Forecasting: Card Modals, Renames & Layer 3 Redesign (2026-07-02)

- **Card drill-downs are now popup modals**, not inline panels. `TsaMetricCards.jsx`'s `DrillDownModal` wraps every card's chart in the new shared `Modal` (`TsaChartKit.jsx`) — centered overlay, closes on backdrop click or ✕. Closing it only clears local `active` state; `filters` is untouched, so the dashboard is exactly as the user left it.
- **Card renames + YTD messaging:** "ASU Actuals" → **Active Service Units**, "SR Actuals" → **Service Requests**. All three of ASU/SR/CPASU swapped their static "Plan X · Y% adherence" sub-line for a YTD year-over-year message (e.g. `YTD FY27: 24.2K · ▲ 8.3% vs FY26`), computed by a new `yoyPct` field per metric in `tsaCardData()` — `null` when there's no prior year in scope (e.g. filtered to a single FY), shown as "no prior year in scope" instead of a misleading 0%. CPASU inverts the color logic (`lowerIsBetter`) since falling CPASU is the good direction.
- **SR Actuals popup**: DB/OSP chart changed from a stacked bar to grouped columns.
- **CPASU popup**: changed from a Composed chart (SR/ASU bars + CPASU line) to a line-only chart of CPASU across fiscal years.
- **ASU Layer → ASU Trend, SR Layer → SR Trend.** Visual 1 renamed "Actuals vs Plan Comparison" (Plan dropdown relabeled "Plan Name"), Visual 2 renamed "Plan vs Plan Comparison", Visual 3 renamed "Plan Impact". Plan Impact's region set changed from `['NAMER','EMEA','APJ']` to `IMPACT_REGIONS = ['AMER','APJ','EMEA','Global']` — reshapes `ASU_REGION_PLANS`/`SR_REGION_PLANS`/`asuLobImpact`/`srLobImpact` too, since all four are built off `IMPACT_REGIONS`.
- **"ASU Impact on SR Trend" → ASU/UCR Impact on SR Analysis.**
  - Visual 1 ("ASU Impact on SR Trend with CPASU" → **CPASU Trend**) redesigned: the old Region/Country toggle is gone. Shows all 4 `IMPACT_REGIONS` by default (grouped ASU/SR bars + CPASU line, one group per region); clicking a region drills into that region's own trend at whichever time granularity is most specific in the top filter bar (Week > Quarter > Year), via new `regionTrendGranularity()`/`cpasuTrendByRegion()` selectors.
  - Visual 2 ("UCR Impact on SR") kept its name; series renamed **SR's** (was "SR (Human)") and **UCR Handled SR's** (was "SR (Bots)"); gained a Plan Name selector in the top-right corner via `Visual`'s new `cornerControls` slot — cosmetic/unwired for now, same as AsuLayer/SrLayer Visual 1's Plan dropdown.
  - Visual 3 ("UCR Runrate with Target") now always renders all 3 fiscal years (ignores Quarter/Week narrowing) and dropped its always-visible "queues not adhering" list. Clicking a year's bar opens a modal (new `topNonAdherentLobsByYear()` selector) listing that year's top 5 non-adherent **LOBs** (not queues). `ucrNonAdherentQueues()` and its fallback constant were removed as dead code.

**Verification:** `npm run build` succeeds cleanly. This session's environment doesn't have browser-automation tooling available, so the popups/drill-throughs were verified by code review and a grep sweep for stale references, not by clicking through a rendered browser — worth a manual pass before treating this as fully verified.

## New page: TSA Forecasting (2026-07-02, renamed same day)

The dashboard now has **two pages**, switched via a pill toggle in the header (same `.drill-toggle`/`.drill-btn` pattern used elsewhere): **MSG Forecasting** (everything below, unchanged) and **TSA Forecasting** (new — originally built and briefly named "MSG Capacity Planning", renamed at the user's request before anything shipped further). `App.jsx` is now a thin shell — header + toggle + footer — that renders `ForecastingPage.jsx` (the old `App.jsx` body, extracted verbatim) or `TsaForecastingPage.jsx` depending on which pill is active.

TSA Forecasting is built from **slides 5–6 of `SPOG_views.pptx`** (the ASU/SR/UCR mockups the user confirmed via screenshot), not the slides originally guessed. Structure:

| Section | File | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Filter bar (7 filters: LOB, Fiscal Year/Quarter/Month/Week, Business Partner, Global Grouping) | `TsaFilterPanel.jsx` | Same clustered/searchable-multi-select pattern as MSG Forecasting |
| 5 KPI cards (ASU Actuals, SR Actuals, CPASU, Current UCR, UCR Impacted SR) | `TsaMetricCards.jsx` | Same card + inline drill-down-chart pattern as MSG Forecasting |
| Layer 01 — ASU Layer | `AsuLayer.jsx` | Actual vs Plan+Adherence, Plan-on-Plan, Plan Impact Analysis (click a region bar → LOB contribution list) |
| Layer 02 — SR Layer | `SrLayer.jsx` | Same 3 visuals as ASU Layer, SR metric |
| Layer 03 — ASU Impact on SR Trend | `AsuSrTrendLayer.jsx` | ASU/SR + CPASU trend (Region/Country toggle), UCR Impact on SR (human vs bots stacked), UCR Runrate with Target + non-adherent queue list |
| Layer 04 — Geo Map | `TsaGeoMap.jsx` | Choropleth by LOB adherence per region (no Region/Sub-region toggle — deck only specifies region-level) |

All of the above, plus the shared chart primitives (`TsaChartKit.jsx`) and the data module (`tsaData.js`), live under `src/components/tsa/` and `src/data/tsaData.js` — renamed from `capacity/`/`capacityData.js` in the same pass as the page label.

No RCA/CLCA sidebar on this page — that panel's content is Forecasting-specific and wasn't part of the ASU/SR/UCR slides; revisit if the user wants an equivalent for TSA Forecasting.

**Real data used:**
- **33 real LOB names** (BackupWave, CryptoGuard, DataVault, High End Storage, ScaleVault, ApexArray, CloudBase, FlashCore, etc. — user-supplied verbatim) back the LOB filter and every `LOB_LIST`-keyed structure in `tsaData.js`.
- **Real active/inactive queue lists for the "High End Storage" LOB** (71 active, ~150 inactive, user-supplied verbatim, stored in `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']`) — when the LOB filter is scoped to "High End Storage", the "UCR Runrate with Target" non-adherent-queue list switches from a generic fallback to these real queue names. Verified live: filtering to High End Storage shows real names like "APJ TSA MIDRANGE Japanese" and "Global TSA Midrange FL" in that list.
- `GLOBAL_GROUPING_LIST = ['Consumer','Commercial','Enterprise']` is an inference (not yet explicitly confirmed by the user) based on an earlier PPT note about a future Shipment Trend page — flagged as illustrative in code.
- Everything else (ASU/SR volumes, UCR targets, region-plan-impact deltas, adherence-by-region) is illustrative mock data generated deterministically, same "real names + illustrative structure" convention as the MSG Forecasting page.

**Bug fixed during verification:** `buildLobImpact()`'s delta formula (`(i*7 + ri*13) % 21`) only produced 3 distinct values per region, so multiple LOBs in the "Plan Impact Analysis" drill-down showed an identical delta (e.g. six LOBs all reading `-2400` for NAMER). Fixed by using `(i*17 + ri*41) % 131` — 17 is coprime with the prime modulus 131, so the mapping is injective across all 33 LOBs for a fixed region, guaranteeing distinct deltas.

---

## Latest polish pass (2026-07-02)

- Diverging "Top Queue Variance" charts (both layers) now print the exact `+X%`/`-X%` value at the end of each bar via two sign-split `LabelList`s using Recharts' built-in `position="left"`/`"right"` — a hand-computed label position drifted into the bar interior and was unreadable. Axis ticks rounded to clean 5% steps; queue-name truncation now breaks on the last word boundary instead of mid-word.
- Renamed: Layer 1 Visual 1 "Fiscal Year Plan Variance" → **PoP Variation**; Layer 2 Visual 1 "Fiscal Year Adherence" → **Actual vs Plan Variation**.
- RCA & CLCA sidebar now starts at the "Analysis Layers" divider, not "Key Metrics" — the 5 KPI cards span the full page width on their own.
- Forecast Variance Distribution's tooltip now shows queue **counts** per bucket (e.g. "< 10%: 76 queues") instead of repeating the % already printed on the bar — computed from the same DB/OSP-agnostic queue count the Total Queues card uses, so it stays consistent with the rest of the dashboard as filters change.
- Call Volume drill-down (Offered vs Handled) gained a **Handled %** line on a second right-hand axis (0–100%, clean 25% ticks), matching the dual-axis + trend-line pattern already used everywhere else (Adherence %, Accuracy %, Variance %). Colored violet, consistent with the app's "neutral % trend line" convention.
- Both diverging "Top Queue Variance" charts renamed to **Top Queues by Variance** (same name in both layers — disambiguated by which layer they're in) and lost their "Green = ahead · Red = behind" subtitle, since the exact `+X%`/`-X%` value label on every bar already makes the color meaning obvious.

## Current State (as of 2026-07-01)

## Real Data Wired In (as of 2026-07-01)

Queue names, capacity codes, plan names, business partners, sub-regions, and L5 managers are all real values supplied by the business:

| Constant | Count | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `ACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` | 47 (updated 2026-07-02, was 199) | Queue Name filter, feeds the `ACTIVE_QUEUES` fact table |
| `INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` | 146 (updated 2026-07-02, was 406) | Total Queues card total (193 = 47 + 146); not yet drillable |
| `CAPACITY_CODES` | ~610 | Capacity Code filter, tagged onto each active queue |
| `PLAN_NAMES` | 4 (`AOP_FY26Q4_AA`, `FY27 Q1 APR Plan`, `FY27 Q2 JUN Plan`, `FY27Q1_AA`) | Plan Name filter, Layer 1 Plan A/B dropdowns, Layer 2 plan selector |
| `FISCAL_QUARTERS` | 12 (`FY25Q1` ... `FY27Q4`) | Fiscal Quarter filter |
| `FISCAL_WEEK_LIST` | 156 (`FY25W01` ... `FY27W52`) | Fiscal Week filter |
| `BUSINESS_PARTNERS` | 7 real names | Business Partner filter, tagged onto each active queue |
| `REGIONS` | `['APJ','EMEA','Global','LATAM','NAMER']` | Region filter, Layer 1 `PLAN_VS_PLAN_BY_REGION`, Geo Map |
| `SUB_REGIONS` | 24 real values | Sub-region filter, tagged onto each active queue |
| `L5_MANAGERS` | 15 real names | L5 Manager filter, tagged onto each active queue |

Region for each active queue is inferred from its name prefix (`inferRegion()` in `mockData.js`) — APJ/EMEA/LATAM/NAMER/Global — since no explicit region field was supplied with the queue list.

---

## Filters Are Live (as of 2026-07-01)

The filter bar was rebuilt and every filter now actually drives the charts and cards — this used to be UI-only. See `tech_spec.md` → "Data Model" for the full mechanism. Highlights:

- **`ACTIVE_QUEUES` is now a fact table.** Each of the 199 queues carries region, sub-region, capacity code, business partner, L5 manager, channel, and DB/OSP tags (assigned deterministically, round-robin, since the source lists don't specify a real per-queue mapping — mock data enriched with realistic *structure*, not a real business relationship). `filterQueues(filters)` narrows this table by 8 of the 12 filters; every KPI card, the queue drill-down table, and both "CQN Highest Variance" charts are recomputed from whatever rows remain.
- **DB/OSP scopes volume only, not queue portfolio.** Total Queues / Forecast Accuracy / CQN Variance / the CQN-variance charts ignore the DB/OSP toggle (a queue's accuracy doesn't change depending on which slice of its volume you're viewing); Call Volume / DB-OSP Split respect it fully. This split exists so the default `dbOsp: 'DB'` filter doesn't make the headline "Total Queues" count look wrong on first load.
- **Fiscal Year/Quarter/Week collapsed into one time scope.** Whichever is most specific (Week > Quarter > Year) determines the single FY shown; charts are always at FY granularity now (see below).
- **Region filter narrows the Region chart and the Geo Map** (both view modes) to the matching region. Selecting "Global" on the Geo Map shows an explanatory empty state (no lat/lng data at that granularity), not a blank confusing screen.
- **Plan Name filter pre-selects the primary plan (Plan A)** in both Layer 1 and Layer 2 — the per-visual Plan A/B dropdowns still work independently after that, per the original design decision.
- **Capacity Code, Channel, Business Partner, Sub-region, L5 Manager** all narrow the same fact table, so they affect cards, the drill-down table, and the CQN-variance charts together.

### FY/Quarter/Week toggles removed from charts

Layer 1 Visual 1 and Layer 2 Visual 1 used to have their own `FY / Quarter / Week` segmented toggle, duplicating the top filter bar. That control is gone — those charts are now always at Fiscal Year granularity, and the top-bar Fiscal Year/Quarter/Week filters determine which year(s) they show. `PLAN_VS_PLAN_BY_QTR/WEEK` and `ACTUAL_VS_PLAN_BY_QTR/WEEK` were removed from `mockData.js` since nothing renders them anymore. Layer 1 Visual 2 also lost its Region/Country toggle switch — it never actually changed the chart's data source (a pre-existing latent bug), and no per-country plan-over-plan dataset exists to back a real "Country" view.

### Filter bar redesign

The filter bar was restructured away from a flat 12-dropdown grid (which read like a generic BI slicer panel) into 4 icon-labeled clusters — Scope, Time, People, Geography — with a DB/OSP segmented pill instead of a third binary dropdown, and an "applied filters" chip strip that appears under the bar once anything is scoped (each chip removable, plus "Clear all"). Queue Name and Capacity Code render in a monospace face since they're system codes, not names. See `design_choice.md` for the full rationale.

### Filters are searchable multi-selects

All 11 dropdown filters (everything except DB/OSP, which stays the 3-way segmented pill) are now `MultiSelectField` — a button that opens a popover with a search box, "Select all"/"Clear", and a checkbox list; pick any number of values. This mattered most for Queue Name (originally 199 options, now 47 — see the 2026-07-02 roster update above) and Capacity Code (~610), which were unusable to scroll through as a plain `<select>`.

**Every filter's value changed from a string to an array.** `[]` means "no selection = All" (this replaced the old `'All'` sentinel string everywhere except `dbOsp`). `filterQueues()` and every region/FY selector in `mockData.js` now check `array.includes(value)` instead of `value === selected`. If you're adding a new filter or a new selector function, follow that pattern — see `tech_spec.md` → "Data Model".

## KPI Card Drill-Downs Rebuilt (as of 2026-07-01)

Each card's pop-up went from a raw table to an actual chart matching what the card measures:

| Card | Drill-down now shows |
|---|---|
| Total Queues | **Updated 2026-07-08**: All/Active/Inactive toggle + region breakdown donut (both active and inactive counts always shown, per-region and overall) on top; click a slice/legend entry to filter the queue table below (now spanning both rosters, with a Status column); a new Business Partner Breakdown table underneath, with active/inactive counts per BP that reveal their queue names on hover |
| Call Volume | Bar chart: Offered vs Handled, by Fiscal Year (raw numbers, no %) |
| DB / OSP Split | Bar chart: DB Offered vs OSP Offered, by Fiscal Year — deliberately ignores the ambient DB/OSP filter (showing the split IS the point; collapsing to one bar when the filter is "DB" would defeat it) |
| Forecast Accuracy | Bar+line chart: Actual vs Forecast volume per region (APJ/EMEA/Global/LATAM/NAMER), with a Forecast Accuracy % line on a second axis |
| CQN Variance | Bar chart: % of queues within ±10% variance, year on year (FY25/26/27) — **click a year's bar** to open a pop-up listing 4–5 example queues in that band for the current filter scope |

**CQN Variance headline was recalibrated.** It was reading ~74–80% ("within ±10%"), which felt inflated for how strict that band actually is. The qualifying threshold tightened from `accuracy >= 80` to `accuracy >= 89`, landing the headline at ~40–50% at default filters — a real recomputed number, not a hardcoded one. The year-on-year drill-down (`CQN_VARIANCE_BY_FY` in `mockData.js`) is curated static data in the same 40–50% range, since no per-queue-per-year variance dataset exists yet; the queues shown in the year pop-up are real (pulled from the live filtered fact table), just not year-specific yet.

**The year-click pop-up is an actual modal**, the one deliberate exception to the "no modals" rule established in `design_choice.md` — it's a second level of drill-down nested inside the first, and a floating overlay reads better there than trying to cram another chart inline.

## Chart Redesign, Geo Choropleth, RCA/CLCA Sidebar (2026-07-01)

- **Every chart title is now centered at the top of its panel**, and renamed for clarity: "Fiscal Year Plan Variance", "Regional Plan Variance", "Top Queue Variance — Plan A vs Plan B" (Layer 1); "Fiscal Year Adherence", "Forecast Variance Distribution", "Top Queue Variance — Actual vs Plan" (Layer 2); "Global Adherence Heatmap" (Layer 3); plus renamed KPI drill-down titles.
- **Both "CQN Highest Variance" charts are now diverging bar charts** — one bar per queue, extending right (green, ahead of plan) or left (red, behind plan) from zero, instead of two adjacent bars the reader had to compare by eye. Queue names truncate to ~20 chars on the axis (full name still in the tooltip) so long names no longer wrap to two lines and blow out the row spacing.
- **Color roles were tightened**: violet (`#a78bfa`) is now the neutral "trend line" color (Fiscal Year/Regional Plan Variance lines) so it doesn't compete with green/red, which are reserved exclusively for ahead-of-plan/behind-plan semantics on the diverging charts.
- **Forecast Variance Distribution** (renamed from "Adherence Distribution") re-bucketed from accuracy tiers (≥90/80–90/70–80/<70) to variance-magnitude bands (**<10% / 10–20% / 20–30% / >30%**), with a green→blue→amber→red graduated scale and **data labels printed directly on each stacked segment**.
- **Geo Map is a choropleth now, not circle markers.** Countries are filled by their region's (or sub-region's) accuracy color. The "Country" toggle became **"Sub-region"**, showing the real 24 `SUB_REGIONS` values. Country→region/sub-region groupings in `mockData.js` (`regionForCountry`, `subRegionForCountry`) are an illustrative continental/business split, not authoritative geography. In Sub-region view, countries without a specific named sub-region fall back to their parent region's shade at 35% opacity, so named sub-regions visually "pop" against a fully-covered background map instead of leaving most of the world blank.
- **New RCA & CLCA sidebar** — a sticky right-hand column (`RcaClcaPanel.jsx`) running the full height of the dashboard, next to the KPI cards and all three analysis layers. Content is illustrative example findings/actions, clearly labeled as such, until a real RCA workflow is connected.
- **Fixed while verifying:** `cqnActualVariance`'s underlying per-queue `handled` formula previously guaranteed `handled ≤ offered` for every queue, so the "ahead of plan" (green) case in the Layer 2 diverging chart was structurally impossible — no filter combination could ever trigger it. Widened to a symmetric ±8% range and fixed the sort to rank by `|variance|` (it was ranking by raw ascending variance, always surfacing the worst outliers) so the chart now genuinely shows a mix of green and red, matching its own legend.

## What's NOT Yet Built (from PPT scope)

These are in the original SPOG_views.pptx but not yet implemented:
- Slides 3–4: Staffing / Headcount dashboard (SL%, FTE, Attrition, Utilization)
- Slides 7–9: Workload distribution, SLO heatmaps
- Slides 10–13: Full Forecast Trend page (MAPE, Bias%, queue exception table)
- Slides 14–16: Shipment Trend page (Consumer/Commercial/Enterprise)
- AI-generated RCA & CLCA panel (mentioned in PPT)
- Real backend / data connection (currently all mock data)

## Known Issues / Pending

1. **GitHub Pages source must be manually set** to `gh-pages` branch after first deploy (one-time step).
2. **Geo map** fetches world GeoJSON from CDN (`cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/world-atlas@2`) — requires internet at runtime.
3. Queue/capacity/plan **names** are real; volume, accuracy, and variance **numbers** are still mock/static — no API or database connection yet.
4. Chunk size warning (~697KB bundle) — consider code-splitting recharts and react-simple-maps in future.
5. `INACTIVE_QUEUE_NAMES` (146 real names as of 2026-07-02) is defined in `mockData.js` but has no drill-down UI yet — only the count is shown on the Total Queues card.
6. `LOB_QUEUES`'s real per-queue lists for "High End Storage" now back the TSA Forecasting Total Queues card (2026-07-02) — no longer the dead data flagged in the prior note here.
7. TSA Forecasting's CPASU Trend region/time drill-down (`cpasuTrendByRegion`) is fully synthetic — no real per-region/per-quarter/per-week ASU/SR dataset exists yet, same "illustrative structure" convention as the rest of this page's mock numbers.
8. TSA Forecasting's Total Queues card treats `LOB_QUEUES['High End Storage']`'s real names as the whole page's queue roster (not scoped to that one LOB) — it's the only real per-queue name data supplied for this page; if real per-LOB queue lists arrive for the other 32 LOBs, this should be revisited to decide whether Total Queues should sum across all of them instead.
9. The light/dark theme toggle (2026-07-02) wasn't visually verified in a rendered browser — this session's environment has no browser-automation tool available. Verified instead by a clean production build, grepping the compiled CSS to confirm both `:root` and `[data-theme='light']` variable blocks made it through Tailwind/PostCSS untouched, and a full-codebase grep confirming no stray hardcoded "chrome" colors (background/border/primary-secondary-muted text) were left unconverted. Worth a manual toggle-and-look pass before treating this as fully verified.
10. The View By granularity toggle's sub-year (Quarter/Month/Week) values are entirely synthetic — `expandToGranularity`/`expandRateToGranularity` derive them from the existing FY baselines with a deterministic wobble, since no real quarter/month/week-level dataset exists for any metric on either page. Selecting Month or Week with no Fiscal Year/Quarter/Week filter narrowing shows every period across all 3 fiscal years (36 months / 156 weeks) — verified the math is correct at that volume, but it wasn't visually checked for chart crowding in a rendered browser (same browser-automation gap as item 9).
11. Also renamed AsuLayer's subtitle from "average service unit tracking" to "Active Service Unit tracking" per the 2026-07-02 request.
12. **Two sorting bugs caught by the Node smoke test before UI work began (2026-07-03):** `msgCapacityData.js`'s `utilizationByQueue` sorted ascending by `|utilGap|`, surfacing the *best*-performing queues instead of the worst — fixed to sort descending. `leavesByQueue` sorted ascending by raw delta only, which biased toward negative-delta queues (fewer leaves than planned, not a real problem) and could miss large positive-delta outliers — fixed to first pick the top-N by `|delta|` descending, then re-sort that shortlist ascending for display.
13. The new landing page, MSG/TSA Capacity Plan pages, home button, and per-business sub-toggle (2026-07-03) were verified via a clean `npm run build` and the MSG/TSA Capacity Node data smoke tests, but not visually clicked through in a rendered browser by the agent — this session's environment has no browser-automation tool. The dev server was started and opened in the user's default browser for manual verification instead; worth a manual pass (tiles → toggle → Sankey diagram → home button) before treating this as fully verified.
14. TSA Capacity's Sankey diagram (`workloadSankey()`) uses an illustrative 3-tier CQN taxonomy (`CQN-Standard`/`CQN-Critical`/`CQN-Enterprise`) as flow sources, since this page's filter set has no real per-queue dimension of its own — only the 4 target LOB names are real.
15. MSG Capacity's Region/Sub-region drill (Attrition, Plan over Plan Variation) scales a single FY-level baseline by each key's share of currently-in-scope queues — same "illustrative structure" convention as everywhere else, not a real per-region/sub-region historical dataset.
16. The 2026-07-03 MSG Capacity revision pass (filters, cards, Attrition/Plan-over-Plan drill, Utilization aux detail, Geo Map sub-region toggle) was verified via a Node smoke test + clean build, not a rendered-browser click-through — same standing browser-automation gap as every other UI change this session.
17. MSG Capacity's Cases per FTE card (2026-07-03) intentionally has no YoY comparison/trend pip, unlike every other card on both Capacity pages — this is a deliberate one-off exception, not an oversight, if it looks inconsistent at a glance.
18. TSA Capacity's Region/Sub-region drills (Attrition, Plan over Plan Variation) and Geo Map sub-region view are all illustrative — `subRegion` on `TSA_CAPACITY_LOBS` is a round-robin tag over the real `SUB_REGIONS` list, not a real per-LOB business mapping, same "real names + illustrative structure" convention as everywhere else.
19. TSA Capacity's Workload Distribution Visual2/Visual3 (2026-07-03) both now plot the identical Average Case Time metric (one as bars, one as a line) per direct request — this redundancy is intentional, not a mistake, since the original "Workload Act vs Plan" name was itself a garbled reference to "Average Case Time" all along.
20. The 2026-07-03 TSA Capacity revision pass (filters, YTD cards, Attrition/Plan-over-Plan drill, Sankey LOB/CQN toggle, Workload ACT rework, Geo Map sub-region toggle, RCA/CLCA sidebar) was verified via an extended Node smoke test + clean build only — same standing browser-automation gap as every other UI change this session.
21. `INACTIVE_QUEUES`' region/businessPartner tags (2026-07-08) are illustrative round-robin assignments, not a real business mapping — same caveat as `ACTIVE_QUEUES`'s own tags, which this mirrors. `allQueuesByStatus`/`queuesByBusinessPartner` only honor the Region/Business Partner filters (the two dimensions the inactive roster has); the Total Queues drill-down's other filter dimensions (Capacity Code, Channel, Sub-region, L5 Manager) only narrow the active side, same reasoning as the existing DB/OSP exemption for this card.
22. The Total Queues drill-down rework (2026-07-08) was verified via a Node smoke test on the new selectors + a clean build, not a rendered-browser click-through — same standing browser-automation gap as every other UI change this session.
